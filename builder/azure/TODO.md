Here's a list of things we like to get done in no particular order:

- [ ] Blob/image copy post-processor
- [ ] Blob/image rename post-processor
- [ ] SSH to private ip through subnet
- [ ] chroot builder
- [ ] support cross-storage account image source (i.e. pre-build blob copy)
- [ ] look up object id when using device code (graph api /me ?)
- [ ] device flow support for Windows
- [x] look up tenant id in all cases (see device flow code)
- [ ] look up resource group of storage account
- [ ] include all _data_ disks in artifact too
- [ ] windows sysprep provisioner (since it seems to generate a certain issue volume)
- [ ] allow arbitrary json patching for deployment document
- [ ] tag all resources with user-supplied tag
- [ ] managed disk support
