    processing. This allows you to extract artifacts from a packer builder and
    use them with other post-processors like compress, docker, and Atlas.

IMPROVEMENTS:

  * core: Packer plugins are now compiled into the main binary, reducing file
    size and build times, and making packer easier to install. The overall
    plugin architecture has not changed and third-party plugins can still be
    loaded from disk. Please make sure your plugins are up-to-date! [GH-2854]
