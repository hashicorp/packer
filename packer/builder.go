// This is a boolean value. If it is set to true, then the builder should
// enable a debug mode which allows builder developers and advanced users
// to introspect what is going on during a build. During debug builds,
// parallelism is strictly disabled, so it is safe to request input from

	// setup only. Calling Prepare is not necessarily followed by a Run.
	//
	// The parameters to Prepare are a set of interface{} values of the
	// configuration. These are almost always `map[string]interface{}`
	// parsed from a template, but no guarantee is made.

	// configuration.

	// that occurred while preparing.
