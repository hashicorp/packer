_Only use GitHub issues to report bugs or feature requests, see

For example, _Timeouts waiting for SSH/WinRM_ are generally not bugs within packer and are better addressed by the mailing list. Ask on the mailing list if you are unsure.

If you are planning to open a pull-request just open the pull-request instead of making an issue first.
