// ShutdownConfig defines implementation details for shutting down a VM once it

//
// It is provided as a convenience to encourage builder developers to
// consider implementing these options, which we believe are valuable for all
// builders. It also helps guarantee that option names for similar options
// are the same across the various builders. Embed it in your builder config
// using the `mapstructure:",squash"` struct tag.

	// provisioning is complete. By default this is an empty string, which

	// be safely omitted if for example, a shutdown command to gracefully halt
	// the machine is configured inside a provisioning script. If one or more
	// scripts require a reboot it is suggested to leave this blank (since
	// reboots may fail) and instead specify the final shutdown command in your
