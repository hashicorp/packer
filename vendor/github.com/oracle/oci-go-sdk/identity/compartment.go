// Compartment A collection of related resources. Compartments are a fundamental component of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
// for organizing and isolating your cloud resources. You use them to clearly separate resources for the purposes
// of measuring usage and billing, access (through the use of IAM Service policies), and isolation (separating the
// resources for one project or business unit from another). A common approach is to create a compartment for each
// major part of your organization. For more information, see
// Overview of the IAM Service (https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm) and also
// Setting Up Your Tenancy (https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/GSG/Concepts/settinguptenancy.htm).
// To place a resource in a compartment, simply specify the compartment ID in the "Create" request object when
// initially creating the resource. For example, to launch an instance into a particular compartment, specify
// that compartment's OCID in the `LaunchInstance` request. You can't move an existing resource from one
// compartment to another.
// To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized,
// talk to an administrator. If you're an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access,
// see Getting Started with Policies (https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm).
