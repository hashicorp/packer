// Policy A document that specifies the type of access a group has to the resources in a compartment. For information about
// policies and other IAM Service components, see
// Overview of the IAM Service (https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm). If you're new to policies, see
// Getting Started with Policies (https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm).
// The word "policy" is used by people in different ways:
//   * An individual statement written in the policy language
//   * A collection of statements in a single, named "policy" document (which has an Oracle Cloud ID (OCID) assigned to it)
//   * The overall body of policies your organization uses to control access to resources
// To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM policy. If you're not authorized,
// talk to an administrator.
