-   `capture_name_prefix` (string) - Capture
    
-   `capture_container_name` (string) - Capture Container Name
-   `shared_image_gallery` (SharedImageGallery) - Use a [Shared Gallery
    image](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/announcing-the-public-preview-of-shared-image-gallery/)
    as the source for this build. *VHD targets are incompatible with this
    build type* - the target must be a *Managed Image*.
    
        "shared_image_gallery": {
            "subscription": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000000",
            "resource_group": "ResourceGroup",
            "gallery_name": "GalleryName",
            "image_name": "ImageName",
            "image_version": "1.0.0"
        }
        "managed_image_name": "TargetImageName",
        "managed_image_resource_group_name": "TargetResourceGroup"
    
-   `shared_image_gallery_destination` (SharedImageGalleryDestination) - The name of the Shared Image Gallery under which the managed image will be published as Shared Gallery Image version.
    
    Following is an example.
    
        "shared_image_gallery_destination": {
            "resource_group": "ResourceGroup",
            "gallery_name": "GalleryName",
            "image_name": "ImageName",
            "image_version": "1.0.0",
            "replication_regions": ["regionA", "regionB", "regionC"]
        }
        "managed_image_name": "TargetImageName",
        "managed_image_resource_group_name": "TargetResourceGroup"
    
-   `shared_image_gallery_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - How long to wait for an image to be published to the shared image
    gallery before timing out. If your Packer build is failing on the
    Publishing to Shared Image Gallery step with the error `Original Error:
    context deadline exceeded`, but the image is present when you check your
    Azure dashboard, then you probably need to increase this timeout from
    its default of "60m" (valid time units include `s` for seconds, `m` for
    minutes, and `h` for hours.)
    
-   `image_version` (string) - Specify a specific version of an OS to boot from.
    Defaults to `latest`. There may be a difference in versions available
    across regions due to image synchronization latency. To ensure a consistent
    version across regions set this value to one that is available in all
    regions where you are deploying.
    
    CLI example
    `az vm image list --location westus --publisher Canonical --offer UbuntuServer --sku 16.04.0-LTS --all`
    
-   `image_url` (string) - Specify a custom VHD to use. If this value is set, do
    not set image_publisher, image_offer, image_sku, or image_version.
    
-   `custom_managed_image_resource_group_name` (string) - Specify the source managed image's resource group used to use. If this
    value is set, do not set image\_publisher, image\_offer, image\_sku, or
    image\_version. If this value is set, the value
    `custom_managed_image_name` must also be set. See
    [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-managed-disks-overview#images)
    to learn more about managed images.
    
-   `custom_managed_image_name` (string) - Specify the source managed image's name to use. If this value is set, do
    not set image\_publisher, image\_offer, image\_sku, or image\_version.
    If this value is set, the value
    `custom_managed_image_resource_group_name` must also be set. See
    [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-managed-disks-overview#images)
    to learn more about managed images.
    
-   `location` (string) - Location
-   `vm_size` (string) - Size of the VM used for building. This can be changed when you deploy a
    VM from your VHD. See
    [pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/virtual-machines/)
    information. Defaults to `Standard_A1`.
    
    CLI example `az vm list-sizes --location westus`
    
-   `managed_image_resource_group_name` (string) - Specify the managed image resource group name where the result of the
    Packer build will be saved. The resource group must already exist. If
    this value is set, the value managed_image_name must also be set. See
    documentation to learn more about managed images.
    
-   `managed_image_name` (string) - Specify the managed image name where the result of the Packer build will
    be saved. The image name must not exist ahead of time, and will not be
    overwritten. If this value is set, the value
    managed_image_resource_group_name must also be set. See documentation to
    learn more about managed images.
    
-   `managed_image_storage_account_type` (string) - Specify the storage account
    type for a managed image. Valid values are Standard_LRS and Premium_LRS.
    The default is Standard_LRS.
    
-   `managed_image_os_disk_snapshot_name` (string) - If
    managed_image_os_disk_snapshot_name is set, a snapshot of the OS disk
    is created with the same name as this value before the VM is captured.
    
-   `managed_image_data_disk_snapshot_prefix` (string) - If
    managed_image_data_disk_snapshot_prefix is set, snapshot of the data
    disk(s) is created with the same prefix as this value before the VM is
    captured.
    
-   `managed_image_zone_resilient` (bool) - Store the image in zone-resilient storage. You need to create it in a
    region that supports [availability
    zones](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/availability-zones/az-overview).
    
-   `azure_tags` (map[string]\*string) - the user can define up to 15
    tags. Tag names cannot exceed 512 characters, and tag values cannot exceed
    256 characters. Tags are applied to every resource deployed by a Packer
    build, i.e. Resource Group, VM, NIC, VNET, Public IP, KeyVault, etc.
    
-   `resource_group_name` (string) - Resource group under which the final artifact will be stored.
    
-   `storage_account` (string) - Storage account under which the final artifact will be stored.
    
-   `temp_compute_name` (string) - temporary name assigned to the VM. If this
    value is not set, a random value will be assigned. Knowing the resource
    group and VM name allows one to execute commands to update the VM during a
    Packer build, e.g. attach a resource disk to the VM.
    
-   `temp_resource_group_name` (string) - name assigned to the temporary resource group created during the build.
    If this value is not set, a random value will be assigned. This resource
    group is deleted at the end of the build.
    
-   `build_resource_group_name` (string) - Specify an existing resource group to run the build in.
    
-   `private_virtual_network_with_public_ip` (bool) - This value allows you to
    set a virtual_network_name and obtain a public IP. If this value is not
    set and virtual_network_name is defined Packer is only allowed to be
    executed from a host on the same subnet / virtual network.
    
-   `virtual_network_name` (string) - Use a pre-existing virtual network for the
    VM. This option enables private communication with the VM, no public IP
    address is used or provisioned (unless you set
    private_virtual_network_with_public_ip).
    
-   `virtual_network_subnet_name` (string) - If virtual_network_name is set,
    this value may also be set. If virtual_network_name is set, and this
    value is not set the builder attempts to determine the subnet to use with
    the virtual network. If the subnet cannot be found, or it cannot be
    disambiguated, this value should be set.
    
-   `virtual_network_resource_group_name` (string) - If virtual_network_name is
    set, this value may also be set. If virtual_network_name is set, and
    this value is not set the builder attempts to determine the resource group
    containing the virtual network. If the resource group cannot be found, or
    it cannot be disambiguated, this value should be set.
    
-   `custom_data_file` (string) - Specify a file containing custom data to inject into the cloud-init
    process. The contents of the file are read and injected into the ARM
    template. The custom data will be passed to cloud-init for processing at
    the time of provisioning. See
    [documentation](http://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/examples.html)
    to learn more about custom data, and how it can be used to influence the
    provisioning process.
    
-   `plan_info` (PlanInformation) - Used for creating images from Marketplace images. Please refer to
    [Deploy an image with Marketplace
    terms](https://aka.ms/azuremarketplaceapideployment) for more details.
    Not all Marketplace images support programmatic deployment, and support
    is controlled by the image publisher.
    
    An example plan\_info object is defined below.
    
    ``` json
    {
      "plan_info": {
          "plan_name": "rabbitmq",
          "plan_product": "rabbitmq",
          "plan_publisher": "bitnami"
      }
    }
    ```
    
    `plan_name` (string) - The plan name, required. `plan_product` (string) -
    The plan product, required. `plan_publisher` (string) - The plan publisher,
    required. `plan_promotion_code` (string) - Some images accept a promotion
    code, optional.
    
    Images created from the Marketplace with `plan_info` **must** specify
    `plan_info` whenever the image is deployed. The builder automatically adds
    tags to the image to ensure this information is not lost. The following
    tags are added.
    
    1.  PlanName
    2.  PlanProduct
    3.  PlanPublisher
    4.  PlanPromotionCode
    
-   `polling_duration_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - The default PollingDuration for azure is 15mins, this property will override
    that value. See [Azure DefaultPollingDuration](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/go-autorest/autorest#pkg-constants)
    If your Packer build is failing on the
    ARM deployment step with the error `Original Error:
    context deadline exceeded`, then you probably need to increase this timeout from
    its default of "15m" (valid time units include `s` for seconds, `m` for
    minutes, and `h` for hours.)
    
-   `os_type` (string) - If either Linux or Windows is specified Packer will
    automatically configure authentication credentials for the provisioned
    machine. For Linux this configures an SSH authorized key. For Windows
    this configures a WinRM certificate.
    
-   `os_disk_size_gb` (int32) - Specify the size of the OS disk in GB
    (gigabytes). Values of zero or less than zero are ignored.
    
-   `disk_additional_size` ([]int32) - The size(s) of any additional hard disks for the VM in gigabytes. If
    this is not specified then the VM will only contain an OS disk. The
    number of additional disks and maximum size of a disk depends on the
    configuration of your VM. See
    [Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/about-disks-and-vhds)
    or
    [Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/about-disks-and-vhds)
    for more information.
    
    For VHD builds the final artifacts will be named
    `PREFIX-dataDisk-<n>.UUID.vhd` and stored in the specified capture
    container along side the OS disk. The additional disks are included in
    the deployment template `PREFIX-vmTemplate.UUID`.
    
    For Managed build the final artifacts are included in the managed image.
    The additional disk will have the same storage account type as the OS
    disk, as specified with the `managed_image_storage_account_type`
    setting.
    
-   `disk_caching_type` (string) - Specify the disk caching type. Valid values
    are None, ReadOnly, and ReadWrite. The default value is ReadWrite.
    
-   `allowed_inbound_ip_addresses` ([]string) - Specify the list of IP addresses and CIDR blocks that should be
    allowed access to the VM. If provided, an Azure Network Security
    Group will be created with corresponding rules and be bound to
    the subnet of the VM.
    Providing `allowed_inbound_ip_addresses` in combination with
    `virtual_network_name` is not allowed.
    
-   `async_resourcegroup_delete` (bool) - If you want packer to delete the
    temporary resource group asynchronously set this value. It's a boolean
    value and defaults to false. Important Setting this true means that
    your builds are faster, however any failed deletes are not reported.
