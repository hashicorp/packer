-   `ami_name` (string) - The name of the resulting AMI that will appear when
    managing AMIs in the AWS console or via APIs. This must be unique. To help
    make this unique, use a function like `timestamp` (see [configuration

<% if ['amazon-instance', 'amazon-ebs'].include? current_page.data.builder %>
-   `instance_type` (string) - The EC2 instance type to use while building the
    AMI, such as "m1.small".

-   `region` (string) - The name of the region, such as "us-east-1", in which to

    bucket will be created if it doesn't exist.

-   `source_ami` (string) - The initial AMI used as a base for the newly

    automatically.
<% elsif 'amazon-chroot' == current_page.data.builder %>
-   `source_ami` (string) - The source AMI whose root volume will be copied and
    provisioned on the currently running instance. This must be an EBS-backed
    AMI with a root volume snapshot that you have access to. Note: this is not
    used when `from_scratch` is set to true.

<% if 'amazon-instance' == current_page.data.builder %>
-   `x509_cert_path` (string) - The local path to a valid X509 certificate for
    your AWS account. This is used for bundling the AMI. This X509 certificate

    the AWS console.

-   `x509_key_path` (string) - The local path to the private key for the X509
    certificate specified by `x509_cert_path`. This is used for bundling
