# Download Community Projects

Packer has a vibrant community of contributors who have built a number of great
tools on top of Packer. There are also quite a few projects demonstrating the
power of Packer templates.

## Third-Party plugins

The plugins listed below have been built by the community of Packer users and
vendors. These plugins are not officially tested nor officially maintained by
HashiCorp, and are listed here in order to help users find them easily.

To learn more about how to use community plugins, or how to build your own,
