# Next Steps

That concludes the getting started guide for Packer. You should now be comfortable
with basic Packer usage, should understand templates, defining builds, provisioners,
etc. At this point you're ready to begin playing with and using Packer
in real scenarios.

From this point forward, the most important reference for you will be
the [documentation](/docs). The documentation is less of a guide and
more of a reference of all the overall features and options of Packer.

If you're interested in learning more about how Packer fits into the
HashiCorp ecosystem of tools, read our [Atlas getting started overview](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/help/getting-started/getting-started-overview).

As you use Packer more, please voice your comments and concerns on
the [mailing list or IRC](/community). Additionally, Packer is
[open source](https://github.com/mitchellh/packer) so please contribute
if you'd like to. Contributions are very welcome.
