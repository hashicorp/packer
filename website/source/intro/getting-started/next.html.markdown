# Next Steps

That concludes the getting started guide for Packer. You should now be
comfortable with basic Packer usage, should understand templates, defining
builds, provisioners, etc. At this point you're ready to begin playing with and
using Packer in real scenarios.

From this point forward, the most important reference for you will be the
[documentation](/docs). The documentation is less of a guide and more of a
reference of all the overall features and options of Packer.

If you're interested in learning more about how Packer fits into the HashiCorp
ecosystem of tools, read our [Atlas getting started
overview](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/help/intro/getting-started).

As you use Packer more, please voice your comments and concerns on the [mailing
list or IRC](/community). Additionally, Packer is [open
source](https://github.com/mitchellh/packer) so please contribute if you'd like
to. Contributions are very welcome.
