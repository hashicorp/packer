# Supported Platforms

Packer can create machine images for any platform. Packer ships with
support for a set of platforms, but can be [extended through plugins](/docs/extend/builder.html)
to support any platform. This page documents the list of supported image
types that Packer supports creating.

If you were looking to see what platforms Packer is able to run on, see
the page on [installing Packer](/intro/getting-started/setup.html).

-> **Note:** We're always looking to officially support more
target platforms. If you're interested in adding support for another
platform, please help by opening an issue or pull request within
[GitHub](https://github.com/mitchellh/packer) so we can discuss
how to make it happen.

Packer supports creating images for the following platforms or targets.
The format of the resulting image and any high-level information about the
platform is noted. They are listed in alphabetical order. For more detailed
information on supported configuration parameters and usage, please see
the appropriate [documentation page within the documentation section](/docs).

* ***Amazon EC2 (AMI)***. Both EBS-backed and instance-store AMIs within
  [EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/), optionally distributed to multiple regions.

* ***DigitalOcean***. Snapshots for [DigitalOcean](http://www.digitalocean.com/)
  that can be used to start a pre-configured DigitalOcean instance of any size.

* ***Docker***. Snapshots for [Docker](http://www.docker.io/)
  that can be used to start a pre-configured Docker instance.

* ***Google Compute Engine***. Snapshots for [Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/products/compute-engine)
  that can be used to start a pre-configured Google Compute Engine instance.

* ***OpenStack***. Images for [OpenStack](http://www.openstack.org/)
  that can be used to start pre-configured OpenStack servers.

* ***Parallels (PVM)***. Exported virtual machines for [Parallels](http://www.parallels.com/downloads/desktop/),
  including virtual machine metadata such as RAM, CPUs, etc. These virtual
  machines are portable and can be started on any platform Parallels runs on.

* ***QEMU***. Images for [KVM](http://www.linux-kvm.org/) or [Xen](http://www.xenproject.org/)
  that can be used to start pre-configured KVM or Xen instances.

* ***VirtualBox (OVF)***. Exported virtual machines for [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/),
  including virtual machine metadata such as RAM, CPUs, etc. These virtual
  machines are portable and can be started on any platform VirtualBox runs on.

* ***VMware (VMX)***. Exported virtual machines for [VMware](http://www.vmware.com/)
  that can be run within any desktop products such as Fusion, Player, or
  Workstation, as well as server products such as vSphere.

As previously mentioned, these are just the target image types that Packer
ships with out of the box. You can always [extend Packer through plugins](/docs/extend/builder.html)
to support more.
