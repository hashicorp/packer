# Docker Import Post-Processor

Type: `docker-import`

The Packer Docker import post-processor takes an artifact from the
[docker builder](/docs/builders/docker.html) and imports it with Docker
locally. This allows you to apply a repository and tag to the image
and lets you use the other Docker post-processors such as
[docker-push](/docs/post-processors/docker-push.html) to push the image
to a registry.

## Configuration

The configuration for this post-processor is extremely simple. At least
a repository is required.

* `repository` (string) - The repository of the imported image.

* `tag` (string) - The tag for the imported image. By default this is not
  set.

## Example

An example is shown below, showing only the post-processor configuration:

```javascript
{
  "type": "docker-import",
  "repository": "mitchellh/packer",
  "tag": "0.7"
}
```

This example would take the image created by the Docker builder
and import it into the local Docker process with a name of `mitchellh/packer:0.7`.

Following this, you can use the
[docker-push](/docs/post-processors/docker-push.html)
post-processor to push it to a registry, if you want.
