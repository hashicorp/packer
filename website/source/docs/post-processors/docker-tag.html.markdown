# Docker Tag Post-Processor

Type: `docker-tag`

The Packer Docker Tag post-processor takes an artifact from the
[docker builder](/docs/builders/docker.html) that was committed
and tags it into a repository. This allows you to use the other
Docker post-processors such as
[docker-push](/docs/post-processors/docker-push.html) to push the image
to a registry.

This is very similar to the [docker-import](/docs/post-processors/docker-import.html)
post-processor except that this works with committed resources, rather
than exported.

## Configuration

The configuration for this post-processor is extremely simple. At least
a repository is required.

* `repository` (string) - The repository of the image.

* `tag` (string) - The tag for the image. By default this is not
  set.

## Example

An example is shown below, showing only the post-processor configuration:

```javascript
{
  "type": "docker-tag",
  "repository": "mitchellh/packer",
  "tag": "0.7"
}
```

This example would take the image created by the Docker builder
and tag it into the local Docker process with a name of `mitchellh/packer:0.7`.

Following this, you can use the
[docker-push](/docs/post-processors/docker-push.html)
post-processor to push it to a registry, if you want.
