# Manifest Post-Processor

Type: `manifest`

The manifest post-processor writes a JSON file with a list of all of the
artifacts packer produces during a run. If your packer template includes
multiple builds, this helps you keep track of which output artifacts (files,
AMI IDs, docker containers, etc.) correspond to each build.

The manifest post-processor is invoked each time a build completes and
*updates* data in the manifest file. Builds are identified by name and type,
and include their build time, artifact ID, and file list.

If packer is run with the `-force` flag the manifest file will be truncated
automatically during each packer run. Otherwise, subsequent builds will be
added to the file. You can use the timestamps to see which is the latest
artifact.

You can specify manifest more than once and write each build to its own file,
or write all builds to the same file. For simple builds manifest only needs to
be specified once (see below) but you can also chain it together with other
post-processors such as Docker and Artifice.

## Configuration

### Optional:

-   `output` (string) The manifest will be written to this file. This defaults
    to `packer-manifest.json`.
-   `strip_path` (boolean) Write only filename without the path to the manifest
    file. This defaults to false.
-   `custom_data` (map of strings) Arbitrary data to add to the manifest.

### Example Configuration

You can simply add `{"type":"manifest"}` to your post-processor section. Below
is a more complete example:

``` json
{
  "post-processors": [
    {
      "type": "manifest",
      "output": "manifest.json",
      "strip_path": true,
      "custom_data": {
        "my_custom_data": "example"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

An example manifest file looks like:

``` json
{
  "builds": [
    {
      "name": "docker",
      "builder_type": "docker",
      "build_time": 1507245986,
      "files": [
        {
          "name": "packer_example",
          "size": 102219776
        }
      ],
      "artifact_id": "Container",
      "packer_run_uuid": "6d5d3185-fa95-44e1-8775-9e64fe2e2d8f",
      "custom_data": {
        "my_custom_data": "example"
      }
    }
  ],
  "last_run_uuid": "6d5d3185-fa95-44e1-8775-9e64fe2e2d8f"
}
```

If the build is run again, the new build artifacts will be added to the
manifest file rather than replacing it. It is possible to grab specific build
artifacts from the manifest by using `packer_run_uuid`.

The above manifest was generated with this packer.json:

``` json
{
  "builders": [
    {
      "type":        "docker",
      "image":       "ubuntu:latest",
      "export_path": "packer_example",
      "run_command": [ "-d", "-i", "-t", "--entrypoint=/bin/bash", "{{.Image}}" ]
    }
  ],
    "provisioners": [
    {
      "type": "shell",
      "inline": "mkdir /Setup"
    },
    {
      "type": "file",
      "source": "../scripts/dummy_bash.sh",
      "destination": "/Setup"
    },
    {
      "type": "shell",
      "inline":["ls -alh /Setup/"]
    }
  ],
  "post-processors": [
    {
      "type": "manifest",
      "output": "manifest.json",
      "strip_path": true,
      "custom_data": {
        "my_custom_data": "example"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
