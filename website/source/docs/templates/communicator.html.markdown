# Templates: Communicators

Communicators are the mechanism Packer uses to upload files, execute
scripts, etc. with the machine being created.

Communicators are configured within the [builder](/docs/templates/builders.html)
section. Packer currently supports three kinds of communicators:

  * `none` - No communicator will be used. If this is set, most provisioners
      also can't be used.

  * `ssh` - An SSH connection will be established to the machine. This is
      usually the default.

  * `winrm` - A WinRM connection will be established.

In addition to the above, some builders have custom communicators they can
use. For example, the Docker builder has a "docker" communicator that uses
`docker exec` and `docker cp` to execute scripts and copy files.

## Using a Communicator

By default, the SSH communicator is usually used. Additional configuration
may not even be necessary, since some builders such as Amazon automatically
configure everything.

However, to specify a communicator, you set the `communicator` key within
a build. Multiple builds can have different communicators. Example:

```javascript
{
    "builders": [{
        "type": "amazon-ebs",
        "communicator": "ssh"
    }]
}
```

After specifying the `communicator`, you can specify a number of other
configuration parameters for that communicator. These are documented below.

## SSH Communicator

The SSH communicator connects to the host via SSH. If you have an SSH
agent enabled on the machine running Packer, it will automatically forward
the SSH agent to the remote host.

The SSH communicator has the following options:

  * `ssh_bastion_host` (string) - A bastion host to use for the actual
    SSH connection.

  * `ssh_bastion_password` (string) - The password to use to authenticate
    with the bastion host.

  * `ssh_bastion_port` (integer) - The port of the bastion host. Defaults to
    22.

  * `ssh_bastion_private_key_file` (string) - A private key file to use
    to authenticate with the bastion host.

  * `ssh_bastion_username` (string) - The username to connect to the bastion
    host.

  * `ssh_disable_agent` (boolean) - If true, SSH agent forwarding will be
    disabled.

  * `ssh_file_transfer_method` (`scp` or `sftp`) - How to transfer files, Secure
    copy (default) or SSH File Transfer Protocol.

  * `ssh_handshake_attempts` (integer) - The number of handshakes to attempt
    with SSH once it can connect. This defaults to 10.

  * `ssh_host` (string) - The address to SSH to. This usually is automatically
    configured by the builder.

  * `ssh_password` (string) - A plaintext password to use to authenticate
    with SSH.

  * `ssh_port` (integer) - The port to connect to SSH. This defaults to 22.

  * `ssh_private_key_file` (string) - Path to a PEM encoded private key
    file to use to authentiate with SSH.

  * `ssh_pty` (boolean) - If true, a PTY will be requested for the SSH
    connection. This defaults to false.

  * `ssh_timeout` (string) - The time to wait for SSH to become available.
    Packer uses this to determine when the machine has booted so this is
    usually quite long. Example value: "10m"

  * `ssh_username` (string) - The username to connect to SSH with.

## WinRM Communicator

The WinRM communicator has the following options.

  * `winrm_host` (string) - The address for WinRM to connect to.

  * `winrm_port` (integer) - The WinRM port to connect to. This defaults to
    5985 for plain unencrypted connection and 5986 for SSL when `winrm_use_ssl` is set to true.

  * `winrm_username` (string) - The username to use to connect to WinRM.

  * `winrm_password` (string) - The password to use to connect to WinRM.

  * `winrm_timeout` (string) - The amount of time to wait for WinRM to
    become available. This defaults to "30m" since setting up a Windows
    machine generally takes a long time.

  * `winrm_use_ssl` (boolean) - If true, use HTTPS for WinRM

  * `winrm_insecure` (boolean) - If true, do not check server certificate
    chain and host name
