# File Provisioner

Type: `file`

The file provisioner uploads files to machines built by Packer. The
recommended usage of the file provisioner is to use it to upload files,
and then use [shell provisioner](/docs/provisioners/shell.html) to move
them to the proper place, set permissions, etc.

The file provisioner can upload both single files and complete directories.

## Basic Example

```javascript
{
  "type": "file",
  "source": "app.tar.gz",
  "destination": "/tmp/app.tar.gz"
}
```

## Configuration Reference

The available configuration options are listed below. All elements are required.

* `source` (string) - The path to a local file or directory to upload to the
  machine. The path can be absolute or relative. If it is relative, it is
  relative to the working directory when Packer is executed. If this is a
  directory, the existence of a trailing slash is important. Read below on
  uploading directories.

* `destination` (string) - The path where the file will be uploaded to in the
  machine. This value must be a writable location and any parent directories
  must already exist.

## Directory Uploads

The file provisioner is also able to upload a complete directory to the
remote machine. When uploading a directory, there are a few important things
you should know.

First, the destination directory must already exist. If you need to
create it, use a shell provisioner just prior to the file provisioner
in order to create the directory.

Next, the existence of a trailing slash on the source path will determine
whether the directory name will be embedded within the destination, or
whether the destination will be created. An example explains this best:

If the source is `/foo` (no trailing slash), and the destination is
`/tmp`, then the contents of `/foo` on the local machine will be uploaded
to `/tmp/foo` on the remote machine. The `foo` directory on the remote
machine will be created by Packer.

If the source, however, is `/foo/` (a trailing slash is present), and
the destination is `/tmp`, then the contents of `/foo` will be uploaded
directly into `/tmp` directly.

This behavior was adopted from the standard behavior of rsync. Note that
under the covers, rsync may or may not be used.
