# Salt Masterless Provisioner

Type: `salt-masterless`

The `salt-masterless` Packer provisioner provisions machines built by Packer using
[Salt](http://saltstack.com/) states, without connecting to a Salt master.

## Basic Example

The example below is fully functional.

```javascript
{
  "type": "salt-masterless",
  "local_state_tree": "/Users/me/salt"
}
```

## Configuration Reference

The reference of available configuration options is listed below. The only required argument is the path to your local salt state tree.

Optional:

* `bootstrap_args` (string) - Arguments to send to the bootstrap script. Usage
  is somewhat documented on [github](https://github.com/saltstack/salt-bootstrap),
  but the [script itself](https://github.com/saltstack/salt-bootstrap/blob/develop/bootstrap-salt.sh)
  has more detailed usage instructions. By default, no arguments are sent to
  the script.

* `local_pillar_roots` (string) - The path to your local
  [pillar roots](http://docs.saltstack.com/ref/configuration/master.html#pillar-configuration).
  This will be uploaded to the `/srv/pillar` on the remote.

* `local_state_tree` (string) - The path to your local
  [state tree](http://docs.saltstack.com/ref/states/highstate.html#the-salt-state-tree).
  This will be uploaded to the `/srv/salt` on the remote.

* `minion_config` (string) - The path to your local
  [minion config](http://docs.saltstack.com/topics/configuration.html).
  This will be uploaded to the `/etc/salt` on the remote.

* `skip_bootstrap` (boolean) - By default the salt provisioner runs
  [salt bootstrap](https://github.com/saltstack/salt-bootstrap) to install
  salt. Set this to true to skip this step.

* `temp_config_dir` (string) - Where your local state tree will be copied
  before moving to the `/srv/salt` directory. Default is `/tmp/salt`.
