# Provisioners

Provisioners use builtin and third-party software to install and configure the
machine image after booting. Provisioners prepare the system for use, so common
use cases for provisioners include:

- installing packages
- patching the kernel
- creating users
- downloading application code

These are just a few examples, and the possibilities for provisioners are
endless.
