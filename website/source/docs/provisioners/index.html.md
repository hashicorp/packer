# Provisioners

Provisioners use builtin and third-party software to install and configure the
machine image after booting. Provisioners prepare the system for use, so common
use cases for provisioners include:

-   installing packages
-   patching the kernel
-   creating users
-   downloading application code

These are just a few examples, and the possibilities for provisioners are
endless.
