# Puppet Server Provisioner

Type: `puppet-server`

The Puppet provisioner configures Puppet to run on the machines
communicating with a Puppet master.

<div class="alert alert-info alert-block">
<strong>Note that Puppet will <em>not</em> be installed automatically
by this provisioner.</strong> This provisioner expects that Puppet is already
installed on the machine. It is common practice to use the
<a href="/docs/provisioners/shell.html">shell provisioner</a> before the
Puppet provisioner to do this.
</div>

## Basic Example

The example below is fully functional and expects a Puppet server to be accessible
from your network.:

<pre class="prettyprint">
{
   "type": "puppet-server",
   "options": "--test --pluginsync",
   "facter": {
     "server_role": "webserver"
   }
}
</pre>

## Configuration Reference

The reference of available configuration options is listed below.

The provisioner takes various options. None are strictly
required. They are listed below:

* `client_cert_path` (string) - Path to the client certificate for the
  node on your disk. This defaults to nothing, in which case a client
  cert won't be uploaded.

* `client_private_key_path` (string) - Path to the client private key for
  the node on your disk. This defaults to nothing, in which case a client
  private key won't be uploaded.

* `facter` (hash) - Additional Facter facts to make available to the
  Puppet run.

* `options` (string) - Additional command line options to pass
  to `puppet agent` when Puppet is ran.

* `puppet_node` (string) - The name of the node. If this isn't set,
   the fully qualified domain name will be used.

* `puppet_server` (string) - Hostname of the Puppet server. By default
  "puppet" will be used.

* `prevent_sudo` (boolean) - By default, the configured commands that are
  executed to run Puppet are executed with `sudo`. If this is true,
  then the sudo will be omitted.

* `staging_directory` (string) - This is the directory where all the configuration
  of Puppet by Packer will be placed. By default this is "/tmp/packer-puppet-server".
  This directory doesn't need to exist but must have proper permissions so that
  the SSH user that Packer uses is able to create directories and write into
  this folder. If the permissions are not correct, use a shell provisioner
  prior to this to configure it properly.
