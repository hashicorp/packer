# Machine-Readable Reference

This is the reference for the various message categories for Packer
[machine-readable output](/docs/command-line/machine-readable.html). Please read
that page if you're unfamiliar with the general format and usage for the
machine-readable output.

The layout of this reference is split into where the types come from. There are
a set of core types that are from Packer core itself. Then there are types that
come from various components of Packer such as the builders, provisioners, and
more.

type-name (data-count)
</dt>
<dd>
    <p>Description of the type.</p>
    <p>
