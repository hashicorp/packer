# Azure Builder (chroot)

Type: `azure-chroot`

The `azure-chroot` builder is able to build Azure managed disk (MD) images. For
more information on managed disks, see [Azure Managed Disks Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/managed-disks-overview).

The difference between this builder and the `azure-arm` builder is that this
builder is able to build a managed disk image without launching an Azure VM 
instance. This can dramatically speed up image builds. It also allows for more
deterministic image content and enables some capabilities that are not possible
with the `azure-arm` builder.

> **This is an advanced builder** If you're just getting started with Packer,
it is recommend to start with the [azure-arm builder](/docs/builders/azure-arm.html),
which is much easier to use.

## How Does it Work?

This builder works by creating a new MD from either an existing source or from
scratch and attaching it to the (already existing) Azure  VM where Packer is
running. Once attached, a [chroot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot) is set
up and made available to the [provisioners](/docs/provisioners/index.html).
After provisioning, the MD is detached, snapshotted and a MD image is created.

Using this process, minutes can be shaved off the image creation process
because Packer does not need to launch a VM instance.

There are some restrictions however:
* The host system must be a similar system (generally the same OS version,
  kernel versions, etc.) as the image being built.
* If the source is a  managed disk, it must be made available in the same
  region as the host system.
* The host system SKU has to allow for all of the specified disks to be
  attached.

## Configuration Reference

There are many configuration options available for the builder. We'll start
with authentication parameters, then go over the Azure chroot builder specific
options.

### Authentication options
None of the authentication options are required, but depending on which
ones are specified a different authentication method may be used. See the
[shared Azure builders documentation](/docs/builders/azure.html) for more
information.

## Chroot Mounts

The `chroot_mounts` configuration can be used to mount specific devices within
the chroot. By default, the following additional mounts are added into the
chroot by Packer:

-   `/proc` (proc)
-   `/sys` (sysfs)
-   `/dev` (bind to real `/dev`)
-   `/dev/pts` (devpts)
-   `/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc` (binfmt\_misc)

These default mounts are usually good enough for anyone and are sane defaults.
However, if you want to change or add the mount points, you may using the
`chroot_mounts` configuration. Here is an example configuration which only
mounts `/prod` and `/dev`:

``` json
{
  "chroot_mounts": [
    ["proc", "proc", "/proc"],
    ["bind", "/dev", "/dev"]
  ]
}
```

`chroot_mounts` is a list of a 3-tuples of strings. The three components of the
3-tuple, in order, are:

-   The filesystem type. If this is "bind", then Packer will properly bind the
    filesystem to another mount point.

-   The source device.

-   The mount directory.
