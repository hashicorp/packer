    The `triton` Packer builder is able to create new images for use with Triton.
    These images can be used with both the Joyent public cloud (which is powered by
    Triton) as well with private Triton installations. This builder uses the Triton
    Cloud API to create images. The builder creates and launches a temporary VM
    based on a specified source image, runs any provisioning necessary, uses the
    Triton "VM to image" functionality to create a reusable image and finally
    destroys the temporary VM. This reusable image can then be used to launch new
    VM's.

# Triton Builder

Type: `triton`

The `triton` Packer builder is able to create new images for use with Triton.
These images can be used with both the [Joyent public
cloud](https://www.joyent.com/) (which is powered by Triton) as well with
private [Triton](https://github.com/joyent/triton) installations.

This builder uses the Triton Cloud API to create these images. Triton also
supports the Docker API however this builder does *not*. If you want to create
Docker images on Triton you should use the Packer Docker builder.

The builder creates and launches a temporary VM based on a specified source
image, runs any provisioning necessary, uses the Triton "VM to image"
functionality to create a reusable image and finally destroys the temporary VM.
This reusable image can then be used to launch new VM's.

The builder does *not* manage images. Once it creates an image, it is up to you
to use it or delete it.

## Configuration Reference

There are many configuration options available for the builder. They are
segmented below into two categories: required and optional parameters.

In addition to the options listed here, a
[communicator](/docs/templates/communicator.html) can be configured for this
builder.

### Required:

-   `triton_account` (string) - The username of the Triton account to use when
    using the Triton Cloud API.
-   `triton_key_id` (string) - The fingerprint of the public key of the SSH key
    pair to use for authentication with the Triton Cloud API.
-   `triton_key_material` (string) - Path to the file in which the private key
    of `triton_key_id` is stored. For example `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.

-   `source_machine_image` (string) - The UUID of the image to base the new
    image on. Triton supports multiple types of images, called 'brands' in
    Triton / Joyent lingo, for contains and VM's. See the chapter [Containers
    and virtual machines](https://docs.joyent.com/public-cloud/instances) in the
    Joyent Triton documentation for detailed information. The following brands
    are currently supported by this builder:`joyent` and`kvm`. The choice of
    base image automatically decides the brand. On the Joyent public cloud a
    valid `source_machine_image` could for example be
    `70e3ae72-96b6-11e6-9056-9737fd4d0764` for version 16.3.1 of the 64bit
    SmartOS base image (a 'joyent' brand image).

-   `source_machine_package` (string) - The Triton package to use while building
    the image. Does not affect (and does not have to be the same) as the package
    which will be used for a VM instance running this image. On the Joyent
    public cloud this could for example be `g3-standard-0.5-smartos`.

-   `image_name` (string) - The name the finished image in Triton will be
    assigned. Maximum 512 characters but should in practice be much shorter
    (think between 5 and 20 characters). For example `postgresql-95-server` for
    an image used as a PostgreSQL 9.5 server.
-   `image_version` (string) - The version string for this image. Maximum 128
    characters. Any string will do but a format of `Major.Minor.Patch` is
    strongly advised by Joyent. See [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/)
    for more information on the `Major.Minor.Patch` versioning format.

### Optional:

-   `triton_url` (string) - The URL of the Triton cloud API to use. If omitted
    it will default to the URL of the Joyent Public cloud. If you are using your
    own private Triton installation you will have to supply the URL of the cloud
    API of your own Triton installation.

-   `source_machine_firewall_enabled` (boolean) - Whether or not the firewall of
    the VM used to create an image of is enabled. The Triton firewall only
    filters inbound traffic to the VM. All outbound traffic is always allowed.
    Currently this builder does not provide an interface to add specific
    firewall rules. Unless you have a global rule defined in Triton which allows
    SSH traffic enabling the firewall will interfere with the SSH provisioner.
    The default is `false`.
-   `source_machine_metadata` (object of key/value strings) - Triton metadata
    applied to the VM used to create the image. Metadata can be used to pass
    configuration information to the VM without the need for networking. See
    [Using the metadata
    API](https://docs.joyent.com/private-cloud/instances/using-mdata) in the
    Joyent documentation for more information. This can for example be used to
    set the `user-script` metadata key to have Triton start a user supplied
    script after the VM has booted.
-   `source_machine_name` (string) - Name of the VM used for building the image.
    Does not affect (and does not have to be the same) as the name for a VM
    instance running this image. Maximum 512 characters but should in practice
    be much shorter (think between 5 and 20 characters). For example
    `mysql-64-server-image-builder`. When omitted defaults to
    `packer-builder-[image_name]`.
-   `source_machine_networks` (array of strings) - The UUID's of Triton networks
    added to the source machine used for creating the image. For example if any
    of the provisioners which are run need Internet access you will need to add
    the UUID's of the appropriate networks here.
-   `source_machine_tags` (object of key/value strings) - Tags applied to the VM
    used to create the image.

-   `image_acls` (array of strings) - The UUID's of the users which will have
    access to this image. When omitted only the owner (the Triton user whose
    credentials are used) will have access to the image.
-   `image_description` (string) - Description of the image. Maximum 512
    characters.
-   `image_eula_url` (string) - URL of the End User License Agreement (EULA) for
    the image. Maximum 128 characters.
-   `image_homepage` (string) - URL of the homepage where users can find
    information about the image. Maximum 128 characters.
-   `image_tags` (object of key/value strings) - Tag applied to the image.

## Basic Example

Below is a minimal example to create an joyent-brand image on the Joyent public
cloud:

``` {.javascript}
"builders": [{
  "type": "triton",
  "triton_account": "triton_username",
  "triton_key_id": "6b:95:03:3d:d3:6e:52:69:01:96:1a:46:4a:8d:c1:7e",
  "triton_key_material": "~/.ssh/id_rsa",
  "source_machine_name": "image-builder",
  "source_machine_package": "g3-standard-0.5-smartos",
  "source_machine_image": "70e3ae72-96b6-11e6-9056-9737fd4d0764",
  "ssh_username": "root",
  "ssh_private_key_file": "~/.ssh/id_rsa",
  "image_name": "my_new_image",
  "image_version": "1.0.0",
}],
```

In the above example the SSH key used for `triton_key_material` (connecting to
the Cloud API) and the `ssh_private_key_file` (connecting to the VM once it has
started) are the same. This is because Triton automatically configures the root
users to be able to login via SSH with the same key used to create the VM via
the Cloud API. In more advanced scenarios for example when using a
`source_machine_image` one might use different credentials.
