# LXD Builder

Type: `lxd`

The `lxd` Packer builder builds containers for LXD. The builder starts an LXD
container, runs provisioners within this container, then saves the container as
an LXD image.

The LXD builder requires a modern linux kernel and the `lxd` package. This
builder does not work with LXC.

## Basic Example

Below is a fully functioning example.

``` {.javascript}
{
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "lxd",
      "name": "lxd-xenial",
      "image": "ubuntu-daily:xenial",
      "output_image": "ubuntu-xenial",
      "publish_properties": {
        "description": "Trivial repackage with Packer"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Configuration Reference

### Required:

-   `image` (string) - The source image to use when creating the build
    container. This can be a (local or remote) image (name or fingerprint).
    E.G. `my-base-image`, `ubuntu-daily:x`, `08fababf6f27`, ...

    ~&gt; Note: The builder may appear to pause if required to download a
    remote image, as they are usually 100-200MB. `/var/log/lxd/lxd.log` will
    mention starting such downloads.

### Optional:

-   `init_sleep` (string) - The number of seconds to sleep between launching
    the LXD instance and provisioning it; defaults to 3 seconds.

-   `name` (string) - The name of the started container. Defaults to
    `packer-$PACKER_BUILD_NAME`.

-   `output_image` (string) - The name of the output artifact. Defaults to
    `name`.

-   `command_wrapper` (string) - Lets you prefix all builder commands, such as
    with `ssh` for a remote build host. Defaults to `""`.

-   `publish_properties` (map\[string\]string) - Pass key values to the publish
    step to be set as properties on the output image. This is most helpful to
    set the description, but can be used to set anything needed. See
    <https://stgraber.org/2016/03/30/lxd-2-0-image-management-512/> for more
    properties.

-   `launch_config` (map\[string\]string) - List of key/value pairs you wish to
    pass to `lxc launch` via `--config`. Defaults to empty.
