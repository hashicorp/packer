Type: `alicloud-ecs`

The `alicloud-ecs` Packer builder plugin provide the capability to build
customized images based on an existing base images.

builder.

### Required:

    provided, but it can also be sourced from the `ALICLOUD_ACCESS_KEY`
    environment variable.

    You can also obtain the latest instance type table by invoking the
    [Querying Instance Type
    Table](https://intl.aliyun.com/help/doc-detail/25620.htm?spm=a3c0i.o25499en.a3.6.Dr1bik)

## Basic Example

Here is a basic example for Alicloud.

``` json
{
  "variables": {
    "access_key": "{{env `ALICLOUD_ACCESS_KEY`}}",
    "secret_key": "{{env `ALICLOUD_SECRET_KEY`}}"
  },
  "builders": [{
    "type":"alicloud-ecs",
    "access_key":"{{user `access_key`}}",
    "secret_key":"{{user `secret_key`}}",
    "region":"cn-beijing",
    "image_name":"packer_test2",
    "source_image":"centos_7_04_64_20G_alibase_201701015.vhd",
    "ssh_username":"root",
    "instance_type":"ecs.n1.tiny",
    "io_optimized":"true",
    "image_force_delete":"true"
  }],
  "provisioners": [{
    "type": "shell",
    "inline": [
      "sleep 30",
      "yum install redis.x86_64 -y"
    ]
  }]
}
```

~&gt; Note: Images can become deprecated after a while; run
`aliyun ecs DescribeImages` to find one that exists.
