# Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Classic Compute Builder

Type: `oracle-classic`

The `oracle-classic` Packer builder is able to create custom images for use
with [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Classic Compute](https://cloud.oracle.com/compute-classic). The builder
takes a base image, runs any provisioning necessary on the base image after
launching it, and finally snapshots it creating a reusable custom image.

It is recommended that you familiarise yourself with the
[Key Concepts and Terminology](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/iaas/compute-iaas-cloud/stcsg/terminology.html)
prior to using this builder if you have not done so already.

The builder _does not_ manage images. Once it creates an image, it is up to you
to use it or delete it.

## Authorization

This builder authenticates API calls to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Classic Compute using basic
authentication (user name and password).
To read more, see the [authentication documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/iaas/compute-iaas-cloud/stcsa/Authentication.html)

## Configuration Reference

There are many configuration options available for the `oracle-classic` builder.
This builder currently only works with the SSH communicator.

### Required

 -  `api_endpoint` (string) - This is your custom API endpoint for sending
    requests. Instructions for determining your API endpoint can be found
    [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/iaas/compute-iaas-cloud/stcsa/SendRequests.html)

 -  `dest_image_list` (string) - Where to save the machine image to once you've
    provisioned it. If the provided image list does not exist, Packer will create it.

 -  `identity_domain` (string) - This is your customer-specific identity domain
    as generated by Oracle. If you don't know what your identity domain is, ask
    your account administrator. For a little more information, see the Oracle
    [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/get-started/subscriptions-cloud/ocuid/identity-domain-overview.html#GUID-7969F881-5F4D-443E-B86C-9044C8085B8A).

 -  `source_image_list` (string) - This is what image you want to use as your base image.
    See the [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/iaas/compute-iaas-cloud/stcsg/listing-machine-images.html)
    for more details. You may use either a public image list, or a private image list. To see what public image lists are available, you can use
    the CLI, as described [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/iaas/compute-iaas-cloud/stopc/image-lists-stclr-and-nmcli.html#GUID-DB7E75FE-F752-4FF7-AB70-3C8DCDFCA0FA)

 -  `password` (string) - Your account password.

 -  `shape` (string) - The template that determines the number of
    CPUs, amount of memory, and other resources allocated to a newly created
    instance. For more information about shapes, see the documentation [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/iaas/compute-iaas-cloud/stcsg/machine-images-and-shapes.html).

 -  `username` (string) - Your account username.

### Optional

 -  `attributes` (string) - (string) - Attributes to apply when launching the 
    instance. Note that you need to be careful about escaping characters due to 
    the templates being JSON. It is often more convenient to use 
    `attributes_file`, instead. You may only define either `attributes`  or 
    `attributes_file`, not both.

 -  `attributes_file` (string) - Path to a json file that will be used for the 
    attributes when launching the instance. You may only define either 
    `attributes` or `attributes_file`, not both.

 -  `image_description` (string) - a description for your destination
    image list. If you don't provide one, Packer will provide a generic description.

 -  `ssh_username` (string) - The username that Packer will use to SSH into the
    instance; defaults to `opc`, the default oracle user, which has sudo
    priveliges. If you have already configured users on your machine, you may
    prompt Packer to use one of those instead. For more detail, see the
    [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/iaas/compute-iaas-cloud/stcsg/accessing-oracle-linux-instance-using-ssh.html).

 -  `image_name` (string) - The name to assign to the resulting custom image.

 - `snapshot_timeout` (string) - How long to wait for a snapshot to be
    created. Expects a positive golang Time.Duration string, which is
    a sequence of decimal numbers and a unit suffix; valid suffixes are `ns`
    (nanoseconds), `us` (microseconds), `ms` (milliseconds), `s` (seconds), `m`
    (minutes), and `h` (hours). Examples of valid inputs: `100ms`, `250ms`, `1s`,
    `2.5s`, `2.5m`, `1m30s`.
    Example: `"snapshot_timeout": "15m"`. Default: `20m`.

## Basic Example

Here is a basic example. Note that account specific configuration has been
obfuscated; you will need to add a working `username`, `password`,
`identity_domain`, and `api_endpoint` in order for the example to work.

``` {.json}
{
    "builders": [
        {
            "type": "oracle-classic",
            "username": "myuser@myaccount.com",
            "password": "supersecretpasswordhere",
            "identity_domain": "#######",
            "api_endpoint": "https://api-###.compute.###.oraclecloud.com/",
            "source_image_list": "/oracle/public/OL_7.2_UEKR4_x86_64",
            "shape": "oc3",
            "image_name": "Packer_Builder_Test_{{timestamp}}",
            "attributes": "{\"userdata\": {\"pre-bootstrap\": {\"script\": [\"...\"]}}}",
            "dest_image_list": "Packer_Builder_Test_List"
        }
    ],
    "provisioners": [
        {
            "type": "shell",
            "inline": ["echo hello"]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Basic Example -- Windows

Attributes file is optional for connecting via ssh, but required for winrm.

The following file contains the bare minimum necessary to get winRM working;
you have to give it the password to give to the "Administrator" user, which 
will be the one winrm connects to. You must also whitelist your computer
to connect via winRM -- the empty braces below whitelist any computer to access
winRM but you can make it more secure by only allowing your build machine 
access. See the [docs](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/iaas/compute-iaas-cloud/stcsg/automating-instance-initialization-using-opc-init.html#GUID-A0A107D6-3B38-47F4-8FC8-96D50D99379B)
for more details on how to define a trusted host.

Save this file as `windows_attributes.json`:

```{.json}
{
    "userdata": {
        "administrator_password": "password",
        "winrm": {}
    }
}
```

Following is a minimal but working Packer config that references this attributes
file:
```{.json}
{
    "variables": {
        "opc_username": "{{ env `OPC_USERNAME`}}",
        "opc_password": "{{ env `OPC_PASSWORD`}}",
        "opc_identity_domain": "{{env `OPC_IDENTITY_DOMAIN`}}",
        "opc_api_endpoint": "{{ env `OPC_ENDPOINT`}}"
    },
    "builders": [
        {
            "type": "oracle-classic",
            "username": "{{ user `opc_username`}}",
            "password": "{{ user `opc_password`}}",
            "identity_domain": "{{ user `opc_identity_domain`}}",
            "api_endpoint": "{{ user `opc_api_endpoint`}}",
            "source_image_list": "/Compute-{{ user `opc_identity_domain` }}/{{ user opc_username`}}/Microsoft_Windows_Server_2012_R2-17.3.6-20170930-124649",
            "attributes_file": "./windows_attributes.json",
            "shape": "oc3",
            "image_name": "Packer_Windows_Demo_{{timestamp}}",
            "dest_image_list": "Packer_Windows_Demo",
            "communicator": "winrm",
            "winrm_username": "Administrator",
            "winrm_password": "password"
        }
    ],
    "provisioners": [
        {
          "type": "powershell",
          "inline": "Write-Output(\"HELLO WORLD\")"
        }
    ]
}
```
