# NAVER CLOUD PLATFORM Builder

The `ncloud` builder allows you to create server images using the [NAVER Cloud
Platform](https://www.ncloud.com/).

## Configuration Reference

### Required:

-   `ncloud_access_key` (string) - User's access key. Go to [\[Account
    Management &gt; Authentication
    Key\]](https://www.ncloud.com/mypage/manage/authkey) to create and view
    your authentication key.

-   `ncloud_secret_key` (string) - User's secret key paired with the access
    key. Go to [\[Account Management &gt; Authentication
    Key\]](https://www.ncloud.com/mypage/manage/authkey) to create and view
    your authentication key.

-   `server_image_product_code` (string) - Product code of an image to create.
    (member\_server\_image\_no is required if not specified)

-   `server_product_code` (string) - Product (spec) code to create.

### Optional:

-   `member_server_image_no` (string) - Previous image code. If there is an
    image previously created, it can be used to create a new image.
    (`server_image_product_code` is required if not specified)

-   `server_image_name` (string) - Name of an image to create.

-   `server_image_description` (string) - Description of an image to create.

-   `block_storage_size` (number) - You can add block storage ranging from 10
    GB to 2000 GB, in increments of 10 GB.

-   `access_control_group_configuration_no` (string) - This is used to allow
    winrm access when you create a Windows server. An ACG that specifies an
    access source (`0.0.0.0/0`) and allowed port (5985) must be created in
    advance.

-   `user_data` (string) - Init script to run when an instance is created.
    -   For Linux servers, Python, Perl, and Shell scripts can be used. The
        path of the script to run should be included at the beginning of the
        script, like \#!/usr/bin/env python, \#!/bin/perl, or \#!/bin/bash.
    -   For Windows servers, only Visual Basic scripts can be used.
    -   All scripts must be written in English.
-   `user_data_file` (string) - A path to a file containing a `user_data`
    script. See above for more information.

-   `region` (string) - Name of the region where you want to create an image.
    (default: Korea)
    -   values: Korea / US-West / HongKong / Singapore / Japan / Germany

      "variables": {
        "ncloud_access_key": "FRxhOQRNjKVMqIz3sRLY",
        "ncloud_secret_key": "xd6kTO5iNcLookBx0D8TDKmpLj2ikxqEhc06MQD2"
      },
      "builders": [
        {
          "type": "ncloud",
          "access_key": "{{user `ncloud_access_key`}}",
          "secret_key": "{{user `ncloud_secret_key`}}",

          "server_product_code": "SPSVRSSD00000011",

          "user_data": "CreateObject(\"WScript.Shell\").run(\"cmd.exe /c powershell Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned & winrm quickconfig -q & sc config WinRM start= auto & winrm set winrm/config/service/auth @{Basic=\"\"true\"\"} & winrm set winrm/config/service @{AllowUnencrypted=\"\"true\"\"} & winrm get winrm/config/service\")",
          "region": "US-West"
        }
      ]
    }

## Requirements for creating Windows images

You should include the following code in the packer configuration file for
provision when creating a Windows server.

      "builders": [
        {
          "type": "ncloud",
          ...
          "user_data":
            "CreateObject(\"WScript.Shell\").run(\"cmd.exe /c powershell Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned & winrm set winrm/config/service/auth @{Basic=\"\"true\"\"} & winrm set winrm/config/service @{AllowUnencrypted=\"\"true\"\"} & winrm quickconfig -q & sc config WinRM start= auto & winrm get winrm/config/service\")",
          "communicator": "winrm",
          "winrm_username": "Administrator"
        }
      ],
      "provisioners": [
        {
          "type": "powershell",
          "inline": [
            "$Env:SystemRoot\\System32\\Sysprep\\Sysprep.exe /oobe /generalize /shutdown /quiet \"/unattend:C:\\Program Files (x86)\\NBP\\nserver64.xml\" "
          ]
        }
      ]

## Note

-   You can only create as many public IP addresses as the number of server
    instances you own. Before running Packer, please make sure that the number
    of public IP addresses previously created is not larger than the number of
    server instances (including those to be used to create server images).
-   When you forcibly terminate the packer process or close the terminal
    (command) window where the process is running, the resources may not be
    cleaned up as the packer process no longer runs. In this case, you should
    manually clean up the resources associated with the process.
