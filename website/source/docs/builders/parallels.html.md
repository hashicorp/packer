# Parallels Builder

The Parallels Packer builder is able to create [Parallels Desktop for
Mac](https://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/) virtual machines and export
them in the PVM format.

Packer actually comes with multiple builders able to create Parallels machines,
depending on the strategy you want to use to build the image. Packer supports
the following Parallels builders:

-   [parallels-iso](/docs/builders/parallels-iso.html) - Starts from an ISO file,
    creates a brand new Parallels VM, installs an OS, provisions software within
    the OS, then exports that machine to create an image. This is best for people
    who want to start from scratch.

-   [parallels-pvm](/docs/builders/parallels-pvm.html) - This builder imports an
    existing PVM file, runs provisioners on top of that VM, and exports that
    machine to create an image. This is best if you have an existing Parallels VM
    export you want to use as the source. As an additional benefit, you can feed
    the artifact of this builder back into itself to iterate on a machine.

## Requirements

In addition to [Parallels Desktop for
Mac](https://www.parallels.com/products/desktop/) this requires the [Parallels
Virtualization SDK](https://www.parallels.com/downloads/desktop/).

The SDK can be installed by downloading and following the instructions in the
dmg.

Parallels Desktop for Mac 9 and later is supported, from PD 11 Pro or Business
edition is required.
