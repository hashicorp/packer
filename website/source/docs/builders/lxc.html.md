# LXC Builder

Type: `lxc`

The `lxc` Packer builder builds containers for lxc1. The builder starts an LXC
container, runs provisioners within this container, then exports the container
as a tar.gz of the root file system.

The LXC builder requires a modern linux kernel and the `lxc` or `lxc1` package.
This builder does not work with LXD.

Note to build Centos images on a Debian family host, you will need the `yum` package installed.

Some provisioners such as `ansible-local` get confused when running in a container of a different family.
E.G. it will attempt to use `apt-get` to install packages, when running in a Centos container if the parent OS is Debian based.

## Basic Example

Below is a fully functioning example. 

``` {.javascript}
{
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "lxc",
      "name": "lxc-trusty",
      "config_file": "/tmp/lxc/config",
      "template_name": "ubuntu",
      "template_environment_vars": [
        "SUITE=trusty"
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "lxc",
      "name": "lxc-xenial",
      "config_file": "/tmp/lxc/config",
      "template_name": "ubuntu",
      "template_environment_vars": [
        "SUITE=xenial"
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "lxc",
      "name": "lxc-jessie",
      "config_file": "/tmp/lxc/config",
      "template_name": "debian",
      "template_environment_vars": [
        "SUITE=jessie"
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "lxc",
      "name": "lxc-centos-7-x64",
      "config_file": "/tmp/lxc/config",
      "template_name": "centos",
      "template_parameters": [
        "-R","7",
        "-a","x86_64"
       ],
    }
  ]
}
```

## Configuration Reference

### Required:

-  `config_file` (string) - The path to the lxc configuration file.

-  `template_name` (string) - The LXC template name to use.

-  `template_environment_vars` (array of strings) - Environmental variables to use to build the template with.

### Optional:

-  `target_runlevel` (int) - The minimum run level to wait for the container to reach. Note some distributions (Ubuntu) simulate run levels and may report 5 rather than 3.

-  `output_directory` (string) - The directory in which to save the exported tar.gz. Defaults to `output-<BuildName>` in the current directory.

-  `container_name` (string) - The name of the LXC container. Usually stored in `/var/lib/lxc/containers/<container_name>`. Defaults to `packer-<BuildName>`.

-  `command_wrapper` (string) - Allows you to specify a wrapper command, such as `ssh` so you can execute packer builds on a remote host. Defaults to Empty.

-  `init_timeout` (string) - The timeout in seconds to wait for the the container to start. Defaults to 20 seconds.

-  `template_parameters` (array of strings) - Options to pass to the given `lxc-template` command, usually located in `/usr/share/lxc/templates/lxc-<template_name>``. Note: This gets passed as ARGV to the template command. Ensure you have an array of strings, as a single string with spaces probably won't work. Defaults to `[]`.
