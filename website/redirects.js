 * For destinations with fragments, use an absolute URL.

 * Playground for testing url pattern matching: https://npm.runkit.com/path-to-regexp
 *
 * Note that redirects defined in a product's redirects file are applied to

 * is rendered. Redirect sources should be prefixed with the product slug
 * to ensure they are scoped to the product's section. Any redirects that are
 * not prefixed with a product slug will be ignored.
