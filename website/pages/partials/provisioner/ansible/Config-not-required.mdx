<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in provisioner/ansible/provisioner.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `command` (string) - The command to invoke ansible. Defaults to
   `ansible-playbook`. If you would like to provide a more complex command,
   for example, something that sets up a virtual environment before calling
   ansible, take a look at the ansible wrapper guide below for inspiration.
   Please note that Packer expects Command to be a path to an executable.
   Arbitrary bash scripting will not work and needs to go inside an
   executable script.

- `extra_arguments` ([]string) - Extra arguments to pass to Ansible.
  These arguments _will not_ be passed through a shell and arguments should
  not be quoted. Usage example:
  
  ```json
    "extra_arguments": [ "--extra-vars", "Region={{user `Region`}} Stage={{user `Stage`}}" ]
  ```
  
  If you are running a Windows build on AWS, Azure, Google Compute, or OpenStack
  and would like to access the auto-generated password that Packer uses to
  connect to a Windows instance via WinRM, you can use the template variable
  `{{.WinRMPassword}}` in this option. For example:
  
  ```json
    "extra_arguments": [
      "--extra-vars", "winrm_password={{ .WinRMPassword }}"
    ]
  ```

- `ansible_env_vars` ([]string) - Environment variables to set before
    running Ansible. Usage example:
  
    ```json
      "ansible_env_vars": [ "ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False", "ANSIBLE_SSH_ARGS='-o ForwardAgent=yes -o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPersist=60s'", "ANSIBLE_NOCOLOR=True" ]
    ```
  
    This is a [template engine](/docs/templates/engine). Therefore, you
    may use user variables and template functions in this field.
  
    For example, if you are running a Windows build on AWS, Azure,
    Google Compute, or OpenStack and would like to access the auto-generated
    password that Packer uses to connect to a Windows instance via WinRM, you
    can use the template variable `{{.WinRMPassword}}` in this option. Example:
  
    ```json
    "ansible_env_vars": [ "WINRM_PASSWORD={{.WinRMPassword}}" ],
    ```

- `ansible_ssh_extra_args` ([]string) - Specifies --ssh-extra-args on command line defaults to -o IdentitiesOnly=yes

- `groups` ([]string) - The groups into which the Ansible host should
   be placed. When unspecified, the host is not associated with any groups.

- `empty_groups` ([]string) - The groups which should be present in
   inventory file but remain empty.

- `host_alias` (string) - The alias by which the Ansible host should be
  known. Defaults to `default`. This setting is ignored when using a custom
  inventory file.

- `user` (string) - The `ansible_user` to use. Defaults to the user running
   packer, NOT the user set for your communicator. If you want to use the same
   user as the communicator, you will need to manually set it again in this
   field.

- `local_port` (int) - The port on which to attempt to listen for SSH
   connections. This value is a starting point. The provisioner will attempt
   listen for SSH connections on the first available of ten ports, starting at
   `local_port`. A system-chosen port is used when `local_port` is missing or
   empty.

- `ssh_host_key_file` (string) - The SSH key that will be used to run the SSH
   server on the host machine to forward commands to the target machine.
   Ansible connects to this server and will validate the identity of the
   server using the system known_hosts. The default behavior is to generate
   and use a onetime key. Host key checking is disabled via the
   `ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING` environment variable if the key is generated.

- `ssh_authorized_key_file` (string) - The SSH public key of the Ansible
   `ssh_user`. The default behavior is to generate and use a onetime key. If
   this key is generated, the corresponding private key is passed to
   `ansible-playbook` with the `-e ansible_ssh_private_key_file` option.

- `sftp_command` (string) - The command to run on the machine being
   provisioned by Packer to handle the SFTP protocol that Ansible will use to
   transfer files. The command should read and write on stdin and stdout,
   respectively. Defaults to `/usr/lib/sftp-server -e`.

- `skip_version_check` (bool) - Check if ansible is installed prior to
   running. Set this to `true`, for example, if you're going to install
   ansible during the packer run.

- `use_sftp` (bool) - Use SFTP

- `inventory_directory` (string) - The directory in which to place the
   temporary generated Ansible inventory file. By default, this is the
   system-specific temporary file location. The fully-qualified name of this
   temporary file will be passed to the `-i` argument of the `ansible` command
   when this provisioner runs ansible. Specify this if you have an existing
   inventory directory with `host_vars` `group_vars` that you would like to
   use in the playbook that this provisioner will run.

- `inventory_file_template` (string) - This template represents the format for the lines added to the temporary
  inventory file that Packer will create to run Ansible against your image.
  The default for recent versions of Ansible is:
  "{{ .HostAlias }} ansible_host={{ .Host }} ansible_user={{ .User }} ansible_port={{ .Port }}\n"
  Available template engines are: This option is a template engine;
  variables available to you include the examples in the default (Host,
  HostAlias, User, Port) as well as any variables available to you via the
  "build" template engine.

- `inventory_file` (string) - The inventory file to use during provisioning.
   When unspecified, Packer will create a temporary inventory file and will
   use the `host_alias`.

- `keep_inventory_file` (bool) - If `true`, the Ansible provisioner will
   not delete the temporary inventory file it creates in order to connect to
   the instance. This is useful if you are trying to debug your ansible run
   and using "--on-error=ask" in order to leave your instance running while you
   test your playbook. this option is not used if you set an `inventory_file`.

- `galaxy_file` (string) - A requirements file which provides a way to
   install roles or collections with the [ansible-galaxy
   cli](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/galaxy/user_guide.html#the-ansible-galaxy-command-line-tool)
   on the local machine before executing `ansible-playbook`. By default, this is empty.

- `galaxy_command` (string) - The command to invoke ansible-galaxy. By default, this is
  `ansible-galaxy`.

- `galaxy_force_install` (bool) - Force overwriting an existing role.
   Adds `--force` option to `ansible-galaxy` command. By default, this is
   `false`.

- `roles_path` (string) - The path to the directory on your local system in which to
    install the roles. Adds `--roles-path /path/to/your/roles` to
    `ansible-galaxy` command. By default, this is empty, and thus `--roles-path`
    option is not added to the command.

- `collections_path` (string) - The path to the directory on your local system in which to
    install the collections. Adds `--collections-path /path/to/your/collections` to
    `ansible-galaxy` command. By default, this is empty, and thus `--collections-path`
    option is not added to the command.

- `use_proxy` (boolean) - When `true`, set up a localhost proxy adapter
  so that Ansible has an IP address to connect to, even if your guest does not
  have an IP address. For example, the adapter is necessary for Docker builds
  to use the Ansible provisioner. If you set this option to `false`, but
  Packer cannot find an IP address to connect Ansible to, it will
  automatically set up the adapter anyway.
  
   In order for Ansible to connect properly even when use_proxy is false, you
  need to make sure that you are either providing a valid username and ssh key
  to the ansible provisioner directly, or that the username and ssh key
  being used by the ssh communicator will work for your needs. If you do not
  provide a user to ansible, it will use the user associated with your
  builder, not the user running Packer.
   use_proxy=false is currently only supported for SSH and WinRM.
  
  Currently, this defaults to `true` for all connection types. In the future,
  this option will be changed to default to `false` for SSH and WinRM
  connections where the provisioner has access to a host IP.
