<!-- Code generated from the comments of the VBoxManageConfig struct in builder/virtualbox/common/vboxmanage_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `vboxmanage` ([][]string) - Custom `VBoxManage` commands to execute in order to further customize
  the virtual machine being created. The value of this is an array of
  commands to execute. The commands are executed in the order defined in
  the template. For each command, the command is defined itself as an
  array of strings, where each string represents a single argument on the
  command-line to `VBoxManage` (but excluding `VBoxManage` itself). Each
  arg is treated as a [configuration
  template](/docs/templates/engine), where the `Name` variable is
  replaced with the VM name. More details on how to use `VBoxManage` are
  below.

- `vboxmanage_post` ([][]string) - Identical to vboxmanage,
  except that it is run after the virtual machine is shutdown, and before the
  virtual machine is exported.
