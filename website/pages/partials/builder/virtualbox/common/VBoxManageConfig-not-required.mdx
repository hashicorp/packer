- `vboxmanage` ([][]string) - Custom `VBoxManage` commands to execute in order to further customize
  the virtual machine being created. The example shown below sets the memory and number of CPUs
  within the virtual machine:
  
  In JSON:
  ```json
  "vboxmanage": [
     ["modifyvm", "{{.Name}}", "--memory", "1024"],
  	  ["modifyvm", "{{.Name}}", "--cpus", "2"]
  ]
  ```
  
  In HCL2:
  ```hcl
  vboxmanage = [
     ["modifyvm", "{{.Name}}", "--memory", "1024"],
     ["modifyvm", "{{.Name}}", "--cpus", "2"],
  ]
  ```
  
  The value of `vboxmanage` is an array of commands to execute. These commands are
  executed in the order defined. So in the above example, the memory will be set
  followed by the CPUs.
  Each command itself is an array of strings, where each string is an argument to
  `VBoxManage`. Each argument is treated as a [configuration
  template](/docs/templates/engine). The only available
  variable is `Name` which is replaced with the unique name of the VM, which is
  required for many VBoxManage calls.

- `vboxmanage_post` ([][]string) - Identical to vboxmanage,
  except that it is run after the virtual machine is shutdown, and before the
  virtual machine is exported.
