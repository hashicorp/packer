<!-- Code generated from the comments of the VBoxManageConfig struct in builder/virtualbox/common/vboxmanage_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

-   `vboxmanage` ([][]string) - Custom `VBoxManage` commands to execute in order to further customize
    the virtual machine being created. The value of this is an array of
    commands to execute. The commands are executed in the order defined in
    the template. For each command, the command is defined itself as an
    array of strings, where each string represents a single argument on the
    command-line to `VBoxManage` (but excluding `VBoxManage` itself). Each
    arg is treated as a [configuration
    template](/docs/templates/engine), where the `Name` variable is
    replaced with the VM name. More details on how to use `VBoxManage` are
    below.
    
-   `vboxmanage_post` ([][]string) - Identical to vboxmanage,
    except that it is run after the virtual machine is shutdown, and before the
    virtual machine is exported.
