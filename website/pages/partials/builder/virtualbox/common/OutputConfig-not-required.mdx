<!-- Code generated from the comments of the OutputConfig struct in builder/virtualbox/common/output_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `output_directory` (string) - This is the path to the directory where the
  resulting virtual machine will be created. This may be relative or absolute.
  If relative, the path is relative to the working directory when packer
  is executed. This directory must not exist or be empty prior to running
  the builder. By default this is output-BUILDNAME where "BUILDNAME" is the
  name of the build.

- `output_filename` (string) - This is the base name of the file (excluding the file extension) where
  the resulting virtual machine will be created. By default this is the
  `vm_name`.
