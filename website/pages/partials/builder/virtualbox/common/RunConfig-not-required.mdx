- `headless` (bool) - Packer defaults to building VirtualBox virtual
  machines by launching a GUI that shows the console of the machine
  being built. When this value is set to true, the machine will start
  without a console.

- `vrdp_bind_address` (string) - The IP address that should be
  binded to for VRDP. By default packer will use 127.0.0.1 for this. If you
  wish to bind to all interfaces use 0.0.0.0.

- `vrdp_port_min` (int) - The minimum and maximum port
  to use for VRDP access to the virtual machine. Packer uses a randomly chosen
  port in this range that appears available. By default this is 5900 to
  6000. The minimum and maximum ports are inclusive.

- `vrdp_port_max` (int) - VRDP Port Max
