- `guest_additions_mode` (string) - The method by which guest additions are
  made available to the guest for installation. Valid options are `upload`,
  `attach`, or `disable`. If the mode is `attach` the guest additions ISO will
  be attached as a CD device to the virtual machine. If the mode is `upload`
  the guest additions ISO will be uploaded to the path specified by
  `guest_additions_path`. The default value is `upload`. If `disable` is used,
  guest additions won't be downloaded, either.

- `guest_additions_path` (string) - The path on the guest virtual machine
   where the VirtualBox guest additions ISO will be uploaded. By default this
   is `VBoxGuestAdditions.iso` which should upload into the login directory of
   the user. This is a [configuration
   template](/docs/templates/engine) where the `Version`
   variable is replaced with the VirtualBox version.

- `guest_additions_sha256` (string) - The SHA256 checksum of the guest
   additions ISO that will be uploaded to the guest VM. By default the
   checksums will be downloaded from the VirtualBox website, so this only needs
   to be set if you want to be explicit about the checksum.

- `guest_additions_url` (string) - The URL to the guest additions ISO
   to upload. This can also be a file URL if the ISO is at a local path. By
   default, the VirtualBox builder will attempt to find the guest additions ISO
   on the local file system. If it is not available locally, the builder will
   download the proper guest additions ISO from the internet.

- `attach_snapshot` (string) - Default to `null/empty`. The name of an
   **existing** snapshot to which the builder shall attach the VM before
   starting it. If no snapshot is specified the builder will simply start the
   VM from it's current state i.e. snapshot.

- `target_snapshot` (string) - Default to `null/empty`. The name of the
    snapshot which shall be created after all provisioners has been run by the
    builder. If no target snapshot is specified and `keep_registered` is set to
    `false` the builder will revert to the snapshot to which the VM was attached
    before the builder has been executed, which will revert all changes applied
    by the provisioners. This is handy if only an export shall be created and no
    further snapshot is required.

- `force_delete_snapshot` (bool) - Defaults to `false`. If set to `true`,
    overwrite an existing `target_snapshot`. Otherwise the builder will yield an
    error if the specified target snapshot already exists.

- `keep_registered` (bool) - Set this to `true` if you would like to keep
    the VM attached to the snapshot specified by `attach_snapshot`. Otherwise
    the builder will reset the VM to the snapshot to which the VM was attached
    before the builder started. Defaults to `false`.

- `skip_export` (bool) - Defaults to `false`. When enabled, Packer will
    not export the VM. Useful if the builder should be applied again on the created
    target snapshot.
