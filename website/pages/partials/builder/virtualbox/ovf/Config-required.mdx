-   `checksum` (string) - The checksum for the source_path file. The type of the checksum is
    specified within the checksum field as a prefix, ex: "md5:{$checksum}".
    The type of the checksum can also be omitted and Packer will try to
    infer it based on string length. Valid values are "none", "{$checksum}",
    "md5:{$checksum}", "sha1:{$checksum}", "sha256:{$checksum}",
    "sha512:{$checksum}" or "file:{$path}". Here is a list of valid checksum
    values:
     * md5:090992ba9fd140077b0661cb75f7ce13
     * 090992ba9fd140077b0661cb75f7ce13
     * sha1:ebfb681885ddf1234c18094a45bbeafd91467911
     * ebfb681885ddf1234c18094a45bbeafd91467911
     * sha256:ed363350696a726b7932db864dda019bd2017365c9e299627830f06954643f93
     * ed363350696a726b7932db864dda019bd2017365c9e299627830f06954643f93
     * file:http://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/MD5SUMS
     * file:file://./local/path/file.sum
     * file:./local/path/file.sum
     * none
    Although the checksum will not be verified when it is set to "none",
    this is not recommended since these files can be very large and
    corruption does happen from time to time.
    
-   `source_path` (string) - The filepath or URL to an OVF or OVA file that acts as the
    source of this build.
