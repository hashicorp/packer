<!-- Code generated from the comments of the RunConfig struct in builder/ucloud/common/run_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `instance_name` (string) - The name of instance, which contains 1-63 characters and only support Chinese,
  English, numbers, '-', '\_', '.'.

- `boot_disk_type` (string) - The type of boot disk associated to UHost instance.
  Possible values are: `cloud_ssd` and `cloud_rssd` for cloud boot disk, `local_normal` and `local_ssd`
  for local boot disk. (Default: `cloud_ssd`). The `cloud_ssd` and `local_ssd` are not fully supported
  by all regions as boot disk type, please proceed to UCloud console for more details.
  
  ~> **Note:** It takes around 10 mins for boot disk initialization when `boot_disk_type` is `local_normal` or `local_ssd`.

- `vpc_id` (string) - The ID of VPC linked to the UHost instance. If not defined `vpc_id`, the instance will use the default VPC in the current region.

- `subnet_id` (string) - The ID of subnet under the VPC. If `vpc_id` is defined, the `subnet_id` is mandatory required.
  If `vpc_id` and `subnet_id` are not defined, the instance will use the default subnet in the current region.

- `security_group_id` (string) - The ID of the fire wall associated to UHost instance. If `security_group_id` is not defined,
  the instance will use the non-recommended web fire wall, and open port include 22, 3389 by default.
  It is supported by ICMP fire wall protocols.
  You may refer to [security group_id](https://docs.ucloud.cn/network/firewall/firewall).

- `eip_bandwidth` (int) - Maximum bandwidth to the elastic public network, measured in Mbps (Mega bit per second). (Default: `10`).

- `eip_charge_mode` (string) - Elastic IP charge mode. Possible values are: `traffic` as pay by traffic, `bandwidth` as pay by bandwidth,
  `post_accurate_bandwidth` as post pay mode. (Default: `traffic`).
  Note currently default `traffic` eip charge mode not not fully support by all `availability_zone`
  in the `region`, please proceed to [UCloud console](https://console.ucloud.cn/unet/eip/create) for more details.
  You may refer to [eip introduction](https://docs.ucloud.cn/unet/eip/introduction).

- `user_data` (string) - User data to apply when launching the instance.
  Note that you need to be careful about escaping characters due to the templates
  being JSON. It is often more convenient to use user_data_file, instead.
  Packer will not automatically wait for a user script to finish before
  shutting down the instance this must be handled in a provisioner.
  You may refer to [user_data_document](https://docs.ucloud.cn/uhost/guide/metadata/userdata)

- `user_data_file` (string) - Path to a file that will be used for the user data when launching the instance.

- `min_cpu_platform` (string) - Specifies a minimum CPU platform for the the VM instance. (Default: `Intel/Auto`).
  You may refer to [min_cpu_platform](https://docs.ucloud.cn/uhost/introduction/uhost/type_new)
     - The Intel CPU platform:
         - `Intel/Auto` as the Intel CPU platform version will be selected randomly by system;
         - `Intel/IvyBridge` as Intel V2, the version of Intel CPU platform selected by system will be `Intel/IvyBridge` and above;
         - `Intel/Haswell` as Intel V3,  the version of Intel CPU platform selected by system will be `Intel/Haswell` and above;
         - `Intel/Broadwell` as Intel V4, the version of Intel CPU platform selected by system will be `Intel/Broadwell` and above;
         - `Intel/Skylake` as Intel V5, the version of Intel CPU platform selected by system will be `Intel/Skylake` and above;
         - `Intel/Cascadelake` as Intel V6, the version of Intel CPU platform selected by system will be `Intel/Cascadelake`;
     - The AMD CPU platform:
         - `Amd/Auto` as the Amd CPU platform version will be selected randomly by system;
         - `Amd/Epyc2` as the version of Amd CPU platform selected by system will be `Amd/Epyc2` and above;

- `use_ssh_private_ip` (bool) - If this value is true, packer will connect to the created UHost instance via a private ip
  instead of allocating an EIP (elastic public ip).(Default: `false`).
