<!-- Code generated from the comments of the ShutdownConfig struct in builder/vsphere/common/step_shutdown.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `shutdown_command` (string) - Specify a VM guest shutdown command. VMware guest tools are used by
  default.

- `shutdown_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - Amount of time to wait for graceful VM shutdown.
  Defaults to 5m or five minutes.

- `disable_shutdown` (bool) - Packer normally halts the virtual machine after all provisioners have
  run when no `shutdown_command` is defined. If this is set to `true`, Packer
  *will not* halt the virtual machine but will assume that you will send the stop
  signal yourself through the preseed.cfg or your final provisioner.
  Packer will wait for a default of five minutes until the virtual machine is shutdown.
  The timeout can be changed using `shutdown_timeout` option.
