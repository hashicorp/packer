-   `library` (string) - Name of the library in which the new library item containing the VM template should be created.
    The Content Library should be of type Local to allow deploying virtual machines.
    
-   `name` (string) - Name of the library item that will be created. The name of the item should be different from [vm_name](#vm_name).
    Defaults to [vm_name](#vm_name) + timestamp.
    
-   `description` (string) - Description of the library item that will be created. Defaults to "Packer imported [vm_name](#vm_name) VM template".
    
-   `cluster` (string) - Cluster onto which the virtual machine template should be placed.
    If cluster and resource_pool are both specified, resource_pool must belong to cluster.
    If cluster and host are both specified, host must be a member of cluster.
    Defaults to [cluster](#cluster).
    
-   `folder` (string) - Virtual machine folder into which the virtual machine template should be placed.
    Defaults to the same folder as the source virtual machine.
    
-   `host` (string) - Host onto which the virtual machine template should be placed.
    If host and resource_pool are both specified, resource_pool must belong to host.
    If host and cluster are both specified, host must be a member of cluster.
    Defaults to [host](#host).
    
-   `resource_pool` (string) - Resource pool into which the virtual machine template should be placed.
    Defaults to [resource_pool](#resource_pool). if [resource_pool](#resource_pool) is also unset,
    the system will attempt to choose a suitable resource pool for the virtual machine template.
    
-   `datastore` (string) - The datastore for the virtual machine template's configuration and log files.
    Defaults to the storage backing associated with the library specified by library.
