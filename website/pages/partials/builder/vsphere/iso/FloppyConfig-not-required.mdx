-   `floppy_img_path` (string) - Datastore path to a floppy image that will be mounted to the VM.
    Example: `[datastore1] ISO/pvscsi-Windows8.flp`.
    
-   `floppy_files` ([]string) - List of local files to be mounted to the VM floppy drive. Can be used to
    make Debian preseed or RHEL kickstart files available to the VM.
    
-   `floppy_dirs` ([]string) - List of directories to copy files from.
    
-   `floppy_label` (string) - The label to use for the floppy disk that
    is attached when the VM is booted. This is most useful for cloud-init,
    Kickstart or other early initialization tools, which can benefit from labelled floppy disks.
    By default, the floppy label will be 'packer'.
