-   `ami_block_device_mappings` (awscommon.BlockDevices) - Add one or more block device mappings to the AMI. These will be attached
    when booting a new instance from your AMI. To add a block device during
    the Packer build see `launch_block_device_mappings` below. Your options
    here may vary depending on the type of VM you use. See the
    [BlockDevices](#block-devices-configuration) documentation for fields.
    
-   `launch_block_device_mappings` (awscommon.BlockDevices) - Add one or more block devices before the Packer build starts. If you add
    instance store volumes or EBS volumes in addition to the root device
    volume, the created AMI will contain block device mapping information
    for those volumes. Amazon creates snapshots of the source instance's
    root volume and any other EBS volumes described here. When you launch an
    instance from this new AMI, the instance automatically launches with
    these additional volumes, and will restore them from snapshots taken
    from the source instance. See the
    [BlockDevices](#block-devices-configuration) documentation for fields.
    
-   `bundle_destination` (string) - The directory on the running instance where the bundled AMI will be
    saved prior to uploading. By default this is /tmp. This directory must
    exist and be writable.
    
-   `bundle_prefix` (string) - The prefix for files created from bundling the root volume. By default
    this is `image-{{timestamp}}`. The timestamp variable should be used to
    make sure this is unique, otherwise it can collide with other created
    AMIs by Packer in your account.
    
-   `bundle_upload_command` (string) - The command to use to upload the bundled volume. See the "custom bundle
    commands" section below for more information.
    
-   `bundle_vol_command` (string) - The command to use to bundle the volume. See the "custom bundle
    commands" section below for more information.
    
-   `x509_upload_path` (string) - The path on the remote machine where the X509 certificate will be
    uploaded. This path must already exist and be writable. X509
    certificates are uploaded after provisioning is run, so it is perfectly
    okay to create this directory as part of the provisioning process.
    Defaults to /tmp.
