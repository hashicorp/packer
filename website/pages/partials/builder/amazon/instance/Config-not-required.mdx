- `ami_block_device_mappings` (awscommon.BlockDevices) - Add one or more block device mappings to the AMI. These will be attached
  when booting a new instance from your AMI. To add a block device during
  the Packer build see `launch_block_device_mappings` below. Your options
  here may vary depending on the type of VM you use. See the
  [BlockDevices](#block-devices-configuration) documentation for fields.

- `launch_block_device_mappings` (awscommon.BlockDevices) - Add one or more block devices before the Packer build starts. If you add
  instance store volumes or EBS volumes in addition to the root device
  volume, the created AMI will contain block device mapping information
  for those volumes. Amazon creates snapshots of the source instance's
  root volume and any other EBS volumes described here. When you launch an
  instance from this new AMI, the instance automatically launches with
  these additional volumes, and will restore them from snapshots taken
  from the source instance. See the
  [BlockDevices](#block-devices-configuration) documentation for fields.

- `bundle_destination` (string) - The directory on the running instance where the bundled AMI will be
  saved prior to uploading. By default this is /tmp. This directory must
  exist and be writable.

- `bundle_prefix` (string) - The prefix for files created from bundling the root volume. By default
  this is `image-{{timestamp}}`. The timestamp variable should be used to
  make sure this is unique, otherwise it can collide with other created
  AMIs by Packer in your account.

- `bundle_upload_command` (string) - The command to use to upload the bundled volume. See the "custom bundle
  commands" section below for more information.

- `bundle_vol_command` (string) - The command to use to bundle the volume. See the "custom bundle
  commands" section below for more information.

- `x509_upload_path` (string) - The path on the remote machine where the X509 certificate will be
  uploaded. This path must already exist and be writable. X509
  certificates are uploaded after provisioning is run, so it is perfectly
  okay to create this directory as part of the provisioning process.
  Defaults to /tmp.
