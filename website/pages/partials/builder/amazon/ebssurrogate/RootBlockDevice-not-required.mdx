<!-- Code generated from the comments of the RootBlockDevice struct in builder/amazon/ebssurrogate/root_block_device.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `source_device_name` (string) - Source Device Name

- `device_name` (string) - The device name exposed to the instance (for
  example, /dev/sdh or xvdh). Required for every device in the block
  device mapping.

- `delete_on_termination` (bool) - Indicates whether the EBS volume is
  deleted on instance termination. Default false. NOTE: If this
  value is not explicitly set to true and volumes are not cleaned up by
  an alternative method, additional volumes will accumulate after every
  build.

- `iops` (int64) - The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS) that
  the volume supports. See the documentation on
  IOPs
  for more information

- `volume_type` (string) - The volume type. gp2 for General Purpose
  (SSD) volumes, io1 for Provisioned IOPS (SSD) volumes, st1 for
  Throughput Optimized HDD, sc1 for Cold HDD, and standard for
  Magnetic volumes.

- `volume_size` (int64) - The size of the volume, in GiB. Required if
  not specifying a snapshot_id.
