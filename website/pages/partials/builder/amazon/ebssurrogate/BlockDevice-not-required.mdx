<!-- Code generated from the comments of the BlockDevice struct in builder/amazon/ebssurrogate/block_device.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `omit_from_artifact` (bool) - If true, this block device will not be snapshotted and the created AMI
  will not contain block device mapping information for this volume. If
  false, the block device will be mapped into the final created AMI. Set
  this option to true if you need a block device mounted in the surrogate
  AMI but not in the final created AMI.
