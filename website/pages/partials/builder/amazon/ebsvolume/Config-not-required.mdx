-   `ena_support` (boolean) - Enable enhanced networking (ENA but not SriovNetSupport) on
    HVM-compatible AMIs. If set, add `ec2:ModifyInstanceAttribute` to your
    AWS IAM policy. Note: you must make sure enhanced networking is enabled
    on your instance. See [Amazon's documentation on enabling enhanced
    networking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/enhanced-networking.html#enabling_enhanced_networking).
    
-   `sriov_support` (bool) - Enable enhanced networking (SriovNetSupport but not ENA) on
    HVM-compatible AMIs. If true, add `ec2:ModifyInstanceAttribute` to your
    AWS IAM policy. Note: you must make sure enhanced networking is enabled
    on your instance. See [Amazon's documentation on enabling enhanced
    networking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/enhanced-networking.html#enabling_enhanced_networking).
    Default `false`.
    
-   `ebs_volumes` (BlockDevices) - Add the block device mappings to the AMI. If you add instance store
    volumes or EBS volumes in addition to the root device volume, the
    created AMI will contain block device mapping information for those
    volumes. Amazon creates snapshots of the source instance's root volume
    and any other EBS volumes described here. When you launch an instance
    from this new AMI, the instance automatically launches with these
    additional volumes, and will restore them from snapshots taken from the
    source instance. See the [BlockDevices](#block-devices-configuration)
    documentation for fields.
    
-   `run_volume_tags` (map[string]string) - Key/value pair tags to apply to the volumes of the instance that is
    *launched* to create EBS Volumes. These tags will *not* appear in the
    tags of the resulting EBS volumes unless they're duplicated under `tags`
    in the `ebs_volumes` setting. This is a [template
    engine](/docs/templates/engine), see [Build template
    data](#build-template-data) for more information.
    
     Note: The tags specified here will be *temporarily* applied to volumes
    specified in `ebs_volumes` - but only while the instance is being
    created. Packer will replace all tags on the volume with the tags
    configured in the `ebs_volumes` section as soon as the instance is
    reported as 'ready'.
    
-   `run_volume_tag` ([]{key string, value string}) - Same as [`run_volume_tags`](#run_volume_tags) but defined as a singular
    repeatable block containing a `key` and a `value` field. In HCL2 mode
    the
    [`dynamic_block`](/docs/configuration/from-1.5/expressions#dynamic-blocks)
    will allow you to create those programatically.
