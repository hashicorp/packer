<!-- Code generated from the comments of the AMIConfig struct in builder/amazon/common/ami_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `ami_description` (string) - The description to set for the resulting
  AMI(s). By default this description is empty.  This is a
  [template engine](/docs/templates/engine), see [Build template
  data](#build-template-data) for more information.

- `ami_virtualization_type` (string) - The type of virtualization for the AMI
  you are building. This option is required to register HVM images. Can be
  paravirtual (default) or hvm.

- `ami_users` ([]string) - A list of account IDs that have access to
  launch the resulting AMI(s). By default no additional users other than the
  user creating the AMI has permissions to launch it.

- `ami_groups` ([]string) - A list of groups that have access to
  launch the resulting AMI(s). By default no groups have permission to launch
  the AMI. all will make the AMI publicly accessible.

- `ami_product_codes` ([]string) - A list of product codes to
  associate with the AMI. By default no product codes are associated with the
  AMI.

- `ami_regions` ([]string) - A list of regions to copy the AMI to.
  Tags and attributes are copied along with the AMI. AMI copying takes time
  depending on the size of the AMI, but will generally take many minutes.

- `skip_region_validation` (bool) - Set to true if you want to skip
  validation of the ami_regions configuration option. Default false.

- `tags` (map[string]string) - Key/value pair tags applied to the AMI. This is a [template
  engine](/docs/templates/engine), see [Build template
  data](#build-template-data) for more information.

- `tag` ([]{key string, value string}) - Same as [`tags`](#tags) but defined as a singular repeatable block
  containing a `key` and a `value` field. In HCL2 mode the
  [`dynamic_block`](/docs/configuration/from-1.5/expressions#dynamic-blocks)
  will allow you to create those programatically.

- `ena_support` (boolean) - Enable enhanced networking (ENA but not SriovNetSupport) on
  HVM-compatible AMIs. If set, add `ec2:ModifyInstanceAttribute` to your
  AWS IAM policy.
  
  Note: you must make sure enhanced networking is enabled on your
  instance. See [Amazon's documentation on enabling enhanced
  networking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/enhanced-networking.html#enabling_enhanced_networking).

- `sriov_support` (bool) - Enable enhanced networking (SriovNetSupport but not ENA) on
  HVM-compatible AMIs. If true, add `ec2:ModifyInstanceAttribute` to your
  AWS IAM policy. Note: you must make sure enhanced networking is enabled
  on your instance. See [Amazon's documentation on enabling enhanced
  networking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/enhanced-networking.html#enabling_enhanced_networking).
  Default `false`.

- `force_deregister` (bool) - Force Packer to first deregister an existing
  AMI if one with the same name already exists. Default false.

- `force_delete_snapshot` (bool) - Force Packer to delete snapshots
  associated with AMIs, which have been deregistered by force_deregister.
  Default false.

- `encrypt_boot` (boolean) - Whether or not to encrypt the resulting AMI when
  copying a provisioned instance to an AMI. By default, Packer will keep
  the encryption setting to what it was in the source image. Setting false
  will result in an unencrypted image, and true will result in an encrypted
  one.
  
  If you have used the `launch_block_device_mappings` to set an encryption
  key and that key is the same as the one you want the image encrypted with
  at the end, then you don't need to set this field; leaving it empty will
  prevent an unnecessary extra copy step and save you some time.

- `kms_key_id` (string) - ID, alias or ARN of the KMS key to use for AMI encryption. This
  only applies to the main `region` -- any regions the AMI gets copied to
  copied will be encrypted by the default EBS KMS key for that region,
  unless you set region-specific keys in AMIRegionKMSKeyIDs.
  
  Set this value if you select `encrypt_boot`, but don't want to use the
  region's default KMS key.
  
  If you have a custom kms key you'd like to apply to the launch volume,
  and are only building in one region, it is more efficient to leave this
  and `encrypt_boot` empty and to instead set the key id in the
  launch_block_device_mappings (you can find an example below). This saves
  potentially many minutes at the end of the build by preventing Packer
  from having to copy and re-encrypt the image at the end of the build.
  
  For valid formats see *KmsKeyId* in the [AWS API docs -
  CopyImage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CopyImage.html).
  This field is validated by Packer, when using an alias, you will have to
  prefix `kms_key_id` with `alias/`.

- `region_kms_key_ids` (map[string]string) - regions to copy the ami to, along with the custom kms key id (alias or
  arn) to use for encryption for that region. Keys must match the regions
  provided in `ami_regions`. If you just want to encrypt using a default
  ID, you can stick with `kms_key_id` and `ami_regions`. If you want a
  region to be encrypted with that region's default key ID, you can use an
  empty string `""` instead of a key id in this map. (e.g. `"us-east-1":
  ""`) However, you cannot use default key IDs if you are using this in
  conjunction with `snapshot_users` -- in that situation you must use
  custom keys. For valid formats see *KmsKeyId* in the [AWS API docs -
  CopyImage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CopyImage.html).
  
  This option supercedes the `kms_key_id` option -- if you set both, and
  they are different, Packer will respect the value in
  `region_kms_key_ids` for your build region and silently disregard the
  value provided in `kms_key_id`.

- `skip_save_build_region` (bool) - If true, Packer will not check whether an AMI with the `ami_name` exists
  in the region it is building in. It will use an intermediary AMI name,
  which it will not convert to an AMI in the build region. It will copy
  the intermediary AMI into any regions provided in `ami_regions`, then
  delete the intermediary AMI. Default `false`.

- `snapshot_tags` (map[string]string) - Key/value pair tags to apply to snapshot. They will override AMI tags if
  already applied to snapshot. This is a [template
  engine](/docs/templates/engine), see [Build template
  data](#build-template-data) for more information.

- `snapshot_tag` ([]{key string, value string}) - Same as [`snapshot_tags`](#snapshot_tags) but defined as a singular
  repeatable block containing a `key` and a `value` field. In HCL2 mode the
  [`dynamic_block`](/docs/configuration/from-1.5/expressions#dynamic-blocks)
  will allow you to create those programatically.

- `snapshot_users` ([]string) - A list of account IDs that have
  access to create volumes from the snapshot(s). By default no additional
  users other than the user creating the AMI has permissions to create
  volumes from the backing snapshot(s).

- `snapshot_groups` ([]string) - A list of groups that have access to
  create volumes from the snapshot(s). By default no groups have permission
  to create volumes from the snapshot(s). all will make the snapshot
  publicly accessible.
