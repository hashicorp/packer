These will be attached when launching your instance. Your
options here may vary depending on the type of VM you use.

Example use case:

The following mapping will tell Packer to encrypt the root volume of the
build instance at launch using a specific non-default kms key:

JSON example:

```json
launch_block_device_mappings: [
  {
     "device_name": "/dev/sda1",
     "encrypted": true,
     "kms_key_id": "1a2b3c4d-5e6f-1a2b-3c4d-5e6f1a2b3c4d"
  }
]
```

HCL2 example:

```hcl
launch_block_device_mappings {
    device_name = "/dev/sda1"
    encrypted = true
    kms_key_id = "1a2b3c4d-5e6f-1a2b-3c4d-5e6f1a2b3c4d"
}
```

Please note that the kms_key_id option in this example exists for
launch_block_device_mappings but not ami_block_device_mappings.
