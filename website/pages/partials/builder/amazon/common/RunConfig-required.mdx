- `instance_type` (string) - The EC2 instance type to use while building the
  AMI, such as t2.small.

- `source_ami` (string) - The source AMI whose root volume will be copied and
  provisioned on the currently running instance. This must be an EBS-backed
  AMI with a root volume snapshot that you have access to. Note: this is not
  used when from_scratch is set to true.
