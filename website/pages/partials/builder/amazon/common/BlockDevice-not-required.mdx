<!-- Code generated from the comments of the BlockDevice struct in builder/amazon/common/block_device.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `delete_on_termination` (bool) - Indicates whether the EBS volume is deleted on instance termination.
  Default false. NOTE: If this value is not explicitly set to true and
  volumes are not cleaned up by an alternative method, additional volumes
  will accumulate after every build.

- `device_name` (string) - The device name exposed to the instance (for example, /dev/sdh or xvdh).
  Required for every device in the block device mapping.

- `encrypted` (boolean) - Indicates whether or not to encrypt the volume. By default, Packer will
  keep the encryption setting to what it was in the source image. Setting
  false will result in an unencrypted device, and true will result in an
  encrypted one.

- `iops` (int64) - The number of I/O operations per second (IOPS) that the volume supports.
  See the documentation on
  [IOPs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_EbsBlockDevice.html)
  for more information

- `no_device` (bool) - Suppresses the specified device included in the block device mapping of
  the AMI.

- `snapshot_id` (string) - The ID of the snapshot.

- `virtual_name` (string) - The virtual device name. See the documentation on Block Device Mapping
  for more information.

- `volume_type` (string) - The volume type. gp2 for General Purpose (SSD) volumes, io1 for
  Provisioned IOPS (SSD) volumes, st1 for Throughput Optimized HDD, sc1
  for Cold HDD, and standard for Magnetic volumes.

- `volume_size` (int64) - The size of the volume, in GiB. Required if not specifying a
  snapshot_id.

- `kms_key_id` (string) - ID, alias or ARN of the KMS key to use for boot volume encryption.
  This option exists for launch_block_device_mappings but not
  ami_block_device_mappings. The kms key id defined here only applies to
  the original build region; if the AMI gets copied to other regions, the
  volume in those regions will be encrypted by the default EBS KMS key.
  For valid formats see KmsKeyId in the [AWS API docs -
  CopyImage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CopyImage.html)
  This field is validated by Packer. When using an alias, you will have to
  prefix kms_key_id with alias/.
