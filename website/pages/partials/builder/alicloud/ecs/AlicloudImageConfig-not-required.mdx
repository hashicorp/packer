-   `image_version` (string) - The version number of the image, with a length
    limit of 1 to 40 English characters.
    
-   `image_description` (string) - The description of the image, with a length
    limit of 0 to 256 characters. Leaving it blank means null, which is the
    default value. It cannot begin with `http://` or `https://`.
    
-   `image_share_account` ([]string) - The IDs of to-be-added Aliyun
    accounts to which the image is shared. The number of accounts is 1 to 10.
    If number of accounts is greater than 10, this parameter is ignored.
    
-   `image_unshare_account` ([]string) - Alicloud Image UN Share Accounts
-   `image_copy_regions` ([]string) - Copy to the destination regionIds.
    
-   `image_copy_names` ([]string) - The name of the destination image,
    [2, 128] English or Chinese characters. It must begin with an
    uppercase/lowercase letter or a Chinese character, and may contain numbers,
    _ or -. It cannot begin with `http://` or `https://`.
    
-   `image_encrypted` (boolean) - Whether or not to encrypt the target images,            including those copied if image_copy_regions is specified. If this option
    is set to true, a temporary image will be created from the provisioned
    instance in the main region and an encrypted copy will be generated in the
    same region. By default, Packer will keep the encryption setting to what
    it was in the source image.
    
-   `image_force_delete` (bool) - If this value is true, when the target image names including those
    copied are duplicated with existing images, it will delete the existing
    images and then create the target images, otherwise, the creation will
    fail. The default value is false. Check `image_name` and
    `image_copy_names` options for names of target images. If
    [-force](/docs/commands/build#force) option is
    provided in `build` command, this option can be omitted and taken as
    true.
    
-   `image_force_delete_snapshots` (bool) - If this value is true, when delete the duplicated existing images, the
    source snapshots of those images will be delete either. If
    [-force](/docs/commands/build#force) option is
    provided in `build` command, this option can be omitted and taken as
    true.
    
-   `image_force_delete_instances` (bool) - Alicloud Image Force Delete Instances
-   `image_ignore_data_disks` (bool) - If this value is true, the image
    created will not include any snapshot of data disks. This option would be
    useful for any circumstance that default data disks with instance types are
    not concerned. The default value is false.
    
-   `skip_region_validation` (bool) - The region validation can be skipped
    if this value is true, the default value is false.
    
-   `tags` (map[string]string) - Key/value pair tags applied to the destination image and relevant
    snapshots.
    
-   `tag` ([]{key string, value string}) - Same as [`tags`](#tags) but defined as a singular repeatable block
    containing a `key` and a `value` field. In HCL2 mode the
    [`dynamic_block`](/docs/configuration/from-1.5/expressions#dynamic-blocks)
    will allow you to create those programatically.
