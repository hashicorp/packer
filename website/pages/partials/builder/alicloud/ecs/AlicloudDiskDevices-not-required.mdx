-   `system_disk_mapping` (AlicloudDiskDevice) - Image disk mapping for system
    disk.
    -   `disk_category` (string) - Category of the system disk. Optional values
        are:
            -   `cloud` - general cloud disk
            -   `cloud_efficiency` - efficiency cloud disk
            -   `cloud_ssd` - cloud SSD
    
         For phased-out instance types and non-I/O optimized instances, the
         default value is cloud. Otherwise, the default value is
         cloud\_efficiency.
    
    -   `disk_description` (string) - The value of disk description is blank by
        default. \[2, 256\] characters. The disk description will appear on the
        console. It cannot begin with `http://` or `https://`.
    
    -   `disk_name` (string) - The value of disk name is blank by default. \[2,
        128\] English or Chinese characters, must begin with an
        uppercase/lowercase letter or Chinese character. Can contain numbers,
        `.`, `_` and `-`. The disk name will appear on the console. It cannot
        begin with `http://` or `https://`.
    
    -   `disk_size` (number) - Size of the system disk, measured in GiB. Value
        range: \[20, 500\]. The specified value must be equal to or greater
        than max{20, ImageSize}. Default value: max{40, ImageSize}.
    
-   `image_disk_mappings` ([]AlicloudDiskDevice) - Add one or more data
    disks to the image.
    
    -   `disk_category` (string) - Category of the data disk. Optional values
        are:
        -   `cloud` - general cloud disk
        -   `cloud_efficiency` - efficiency cloud disk
        -   `cloud_ssd` - cloud SSD
    
        Default value: cloud.
    
    -   `disk_delete_with_instance` (boolean) - Whether or not the disk is
        released along with the instance:
        -   True indicates that when the instance is released, this disk will
            be released with it
        -   False indicates that when the instance is released, this disk will
            be retained.
    -   `disk_description` (string) - The value of disk description is blank by
        default. \[2, 256\] characters. The disk description will appear on the
        console. It cannot begin with `http://` or `https://`.
    
    -   `disk_device` (string) - Device information of the related instance:
        such as `/dev/xvdb` It is null unless the Status is In\_use.
    
    -   `disk_name` (string) - The value of disk name is blank by default. \[2,
        128\] English or Chinese characters, must begin with an
        uppercase/lowercase letter or Chinese character. Can contain numbers,
        `.`, `_` and `-`. The disk name will appear on the console. It cannot
        begin with `http://` or `https://`.
    
    -   `disk_size` (number) - Size of the data disk, in GB, values range:
        -   `cloud` - 5 \~ 2000
        -   `cloud_efficiency` - 20 \~ 2048
        -   `cloud_ssd` - 20 \~ 2048
    
        The value should be equal to or greater than the size of the specific
        SnapshotId.
    
    -   `disk_snapshot_id` (string) - Snapshots are used to create the data
        disk After this parameter is specified, Size is ignored. The actual
        size of the created disk is the size of the specified snapshot.
    
        Snapshots from on or before July 15, 2013 cannot be used to create a
        disk.
    
    -   `disk_encrypted` (boolean) - Whether or not to encrypt the data disk.
        If this option is set to true, the data disk will be encryped and corresponding snapshot in the target image will also be encrypted. By
        default, if this is an extra data disk, Packer will not encrypt the
        data disk. Otherwise, Packer will keep the encryption setting to what
        it was in the source image. Please refer to Introduction of [ECS disk encryption](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/59643.htm)
        for more details.
