- `system_disk_mapping` (AlicloudDiskDevice) - Image disk mapping for system
  disk.

  - `disk_category` (string) - Category of the system disk. Optional values
    are: - `cloud` - general cloud disk - `cloud_efficiency` - efficiency cloud disk - `cloud_ssd` - cloud SSD

    For phased-out instance types and non-I/O optimized instances, the
    default value is cloud. Otherwise, the default value is
    cloud_efficiency.

  - `disk_description` (string) - The value of disk description is blank by
    default. \[2, 256\] characters. The disk description will appear on the
    console. It cannot begin with `http://` or `https://`.

  - `disk_name` (string) - The value of disk name is blank by default. \[2,
    128\] English or Chinese characters, must begin with an
    uppercase/lowercase letter or Chinese character. Can contain numbers,
    `.`, `_` and `-`. The disk name will appear on the console. It cannot
    begin with `http://` or `https://`.

  - `disk_size` (number) - Size of the system disk, measured in GiB. Value
    range: \[20, 500\]. The specified value must be equal to or greater
    than max{20, ImageSize}. Default value: max{40, ImageSize}.

- `image_disk_mappings` ([]AlicloudDiskDevice) - Add one or more data
  disks to the image.

  - `disk_category` (string) - Category of the data disk. Optional values
    are:

    - `cloud` - general cloud disk
    - `cloud_efficiency` - efficiency cloud disk
    - `cloud_ssd` - cloud SSD

    Default value: cloud.

  - `disk_delete_with_instance` (boolean) - Whether or not the disk is
    released along with the instance:
    - True indicates that when the instance is released, this disk will
      be released with it
    - False indicates that when the instance is released, this disk will
      be retained.
  - `disk_description` (string) - The value of disk description is blank by
    default. \[2, 256\] characters. The disk description will appear on the
    console. It cannot begin with `http://` or `https://`.

  - `disk_device` (string) - Device information of the related instance:
    such as `/dev/xvdb` It is null unless the Status is In_use.

  - `disk_name` (string) - The value of disk name is blank by default. \[2,
    128\] English or Chinese characters, must begin with an
    uppercase/lowercase letter or Chinese character. Can contain numbers,
    `.`, `_` and `-`. The disk name will appear on the console. It cannot
    begin with `http://` or `https://`.

  - `disk_size` (number) - Size of the data disk, in GB, values range:

    - `cloud` - 5 \~ 2000
    - `cloud_efficiency` - 20 \~ 2048
    - `cloud_ssd` - 20 \~ 2048

    The value should be equal to or greater than the size of the specific
    SnapshotId.

  - `disk_snapshot_id` (string) - Snapshots are used to create the data
    disk After this parameter is specified, Size is ignored. The actual
    size of the created disk is the size of the specified snapshot.

    Snapshots from on or before July 15, 2013 cannot be used to create a
    disk.

  - `disk_encrypted` (boolean) - Whether or not to encrypt the data disk.
    If this option is set to true, the data disk will be encryped and corresponding snapshot in the target image will also be encrypted. By
    default, if this is an extra data disk, Packer will not encrypt the
    data disk. Otherwise, Packer will keep the encryption setting to what
    it was in the source image. Please refer to Introduction of [ECS disk encryption](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/59643.htm)
    for more details.
