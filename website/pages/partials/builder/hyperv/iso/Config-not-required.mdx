- `disk_size` (uint) - The size, in megabytes, of the hard disk to create
  for the VM. By default, this is 40 GB.

- `use_legacy_network_adapter` (bool) - If true use a legacy network adapter as the NIC.
  This defaults to false. A legacy network adapter is fully emulated NIC, and is thus
  supported by various exotic operating systems, but this emulation requires
  additional overhead and should only be used if absolutely necessary.

- `differencing_disk` (bool) - If true enables differencing disks. Only
  the changes will be written to the new disk. This is especially useful if
  your source is a VHD/VHDX. This defaults to false.

- `use_fixed_vhd_format` (bool) - If true, creates the boot disk on the
  virtual machine as a fixed VHD format disk. The default is false, which
  creates a dynamic VHDX format disk. This option requires setting
  generation to 1, skip_compaction to true, and
  differencing_disk to false. Additionally, any value entered for
  disk_block_size will be ignored. The most likely use case for this
  option is outputing a disk that is in the format required for upload to
  Azure.
