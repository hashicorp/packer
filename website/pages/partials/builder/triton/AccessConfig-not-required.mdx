- `triton_url` (string) - The URL of the Triton cloud API to use. If omitted
  it will default to the us-sw-1 region of the Joyent Public cloud. If you
  are using your own private Triton installation you will have to supply the
  URL of the cloud API of your own Triton installation.

- `triton_user` (string) - The username of a user who has access to your
  Triton account.

- `triton_key_material` (string) - Path to the file in which the private key
  of triton_key_id is stored. For example /home/soandso/.ssh/id_rsa. If
  this is not specified, the SSH agent is used to sign requests with the
  triton_key_id specified.

- `insecure_skip_tls_verify` (bool) - secure_skip_tls_verify - (bool) This allows skipping TLS verification
  of the Triton endpoint. It is useful when connecting to a temporary Triton
  installation such as Cloud-On-A-Laptop which does not generally use a
  certificate signed by a trusted root CA. The default is false.
