-   `triton_url` (string) - The URL of the Triton cloud API to use. If omitted
    it will default to the us-sw-1 region of the Joyent Public cloud. If you
    are using your own private Triton installation you will have to supply the
    URL of the cloud API of your own Triton installation.
    
-   `triton_user` (string) - The username of a user who has access to your
    Triton account.
    
-   `triton_key_material` (string) - Path to the file in which the private key
    of triton_key_id is stored. For example /home/soandso/.ssh/id_rsa. If
    this is not specified, the SSH agent is used to sign requests with the
    triton_key_id specified.
    
-   `insecure_skip_tls_verify` (bool) - secure_skip_tls_verify - (bool) This allows skipping TLS verification
    of the Triton endpoint. It is useful when connecting to a temporary Triton
    installation such as Cloud-On-A-Laptop which does not generally use a
    certificate signed by a trusted root CA. The default is false.
