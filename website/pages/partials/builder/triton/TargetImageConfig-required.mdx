- `image_name` (string) - The name the finished image in Triton will be
  assigned. Maximum 512 characters but should in practice be much shorter
  (think between 5 and 20 characters). For example postgresql-95-server for
  an image used as a PostgreSQL 9.5 server.

- `image_version` (string) - The version string for this image. Maximum 128
  characters. Any string will do but a format of Major.Minor.Patch is
  strongly advised by Joyent. See Semantic Versioning
  for more information on the Major.Minor.Patch versioning format.
