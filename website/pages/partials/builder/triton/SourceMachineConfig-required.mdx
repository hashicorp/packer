- `source_machine_package` (string) - The Triton package to use while
  building the image. Does not affect (and does not have to be the same) as
  the package which will be used for a VM instance running this image. On the
  Joyent public cloud this could for example be g3-standard-0.5-smartos.

- `source_machine_image` (string) - The UUID of the image to base the new
  image on. Triton supports multiple types of images, called 'brands' in
  Triton / Joyent lingo, for contains and VM's. See the chapter Containers
  and virtual machines in
  the Joyent Triton documentation for detailed information. The following
  brands are currently supported by this builder:joyent andkvm. The
  choice of base image automatically decides the brand. On the Joyent public
  cloud a valid source_machine_image could for example be
  70e3ae72-96b6-11e6-9056-9737fd4d0764 for version 16.3.1 of the 64bit
  SmartOS base image (a 'joyent' brand image). source_machine_image_filter
  can be used to populate this UUID.
