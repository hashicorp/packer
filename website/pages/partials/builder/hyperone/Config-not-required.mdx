    It can also be specified via environment variable HYPERONE_API_URL.
    
-   `token_login` (string) - Login (an e-mail) on HyperOne platform. Set this
    if you want to fetch the token by SSH authentication.
    
-   `state_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - Timeout for waiting on the API to complete
    a request. Defaults to 5m.
    
-   `image_name` (string) - The name of the resulting image. Defaults to

-   `image_tags` (map[string]string) - Key/value pair tags to add to the created image.
    
-   `image_tag` ([]{key string, value string}) - Same as [`image_tags`](#image_tags) but defined as a singular repeatable
    block containing a `key` and a `value` field. In HCL2 mode the
    [`dynamic_block`](/docs/configuration/from-1.5/expressions#dynamic-blocks)
    will allow you to create those programatically.
    
-   `image_service` (string) - The service of the resulting image.
    
-   `vm_name` (string) - The name of the created server.
    
-   `vm_tags` (map[string]string) - Key/value pair tags to add to the created server.
    
-   `vm_tag` ([]{name string, value string}) - Same as [`vm_tags`](#vm_tags) but defined as a singular repeatable block
    containing a `key` and a `value` field. In HCL2 mode the
    [`dynamic_block`](/docs/configuration/from-1.5/expressions#dynamic-blocks)
    will allow you to create those programatically.

-   `private_ip` (string) - The ID of the private IP within chosen network
    that should be assigned to the created server.
    
-   `public_ip` (string) - The ID of the public IP that should be assigned to

    with server's private IP.

    Can be useful when using custom api_url. Defaults to public.
    
-   `chroot_disk` (bool) - Chroot Disk
-   `chroot_disk_size` (float32) - Chroot Disk Size
-   `chroot_disk_type` (string) - Chroot Disk Type
-   `chroot_mount_path` (string) - Chroot Mount Path
-   `chroot_mounts` ([][]string) - Chroot Mounts
-   `chroot_copy_files` ([]string) - Chroot Copy Files
-   `chroot_command_wrapper` (string) - How to run shell commands. This defaults to `{{.Command}}`. This may be
    useful to set if you want to set environmental variables or perhaps run

-   `post_mount_commands` ([]string) - As pre_mount_commands, but the commands are executed after mounting the
    root device and before the extra mount and copy steps. The device and
    mount path are provided by `{{.Device}}` and `{{.MountPath}}`.
    
-   `ssh_keys` ([]string) - List of SSH keys by name or id to be added
    to the server on launch.
    
-   `user_data` (string) - User data to launch with the server. Packer will not
