- `api_url` (string) - Custom API endpoint URL, compatible with HyperOne.
  It can also be specified via environment variable HYPERONE_API_URL.

- `token_login` (string) - Login (an e-mail) on HyperOne platform. Set this
  if you want to fetch the token by SSH authentication.

- `state_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - Timeout for waiting on the API to complete

  (see configuration templates for more info).

- `image_description` (string) - The description of the resulting image.

- `image_tags` (map[string]string) - Key/value pair tags to add to the created image.

- `image_tag` ([]{key string, value string}) - Same as [`image_tags`](#image_tags) but defined as a singular repeatable
  block containing a `key` and a `value` field. In HCL2 mode the
  [`dynamic_block`](/docs/configuration/from-1.5/expressions#dynamic-blocks)
  will allow you to create those programatically.

- `image_service` (string) - The service of the resulting image.

- `vm_name` (string) - The name of the created server.

- `vm_tags` (map[string]string) - Key/value pair tags to add to the created server.

- `vm_tag` ([]{name string, value string}) - Same as [`vm_tags`](#vm_tags) but defined as a singular repeatable block
  containing a `key` and a `value` field. In HCL2 mode the
  [`dynamic_block`](/docs/configuration/from-1.5/expressions#dynamic-blocks)
  will allow you to create those programatically.

- `disk_name` (string) - The name of the created disk.

- `disk_type` (string) - The type of the created disk. Defaults to ssd.

- `network` (string) - The ID of the network to attach to the created server.

- `private_ip` (string) - The ID of the private IP within chosen network

  the created server. If network is chosen, the public IP will be associated
  with server's private IP.

- `public_netadp_service` (string) - Custom service of public network adapter.
  Can be useful when using custom api_url. Defaults to public.

- `chroot_device` (string) - Chroot Device

- `chroot_disk` (bool) - Chroot Disk

- `chroot_disk_size` (float32) - Chroot Disk Size

- `chroot_disk_type` (string) - Chroot Disk Type

- `chroot_mount_path` (string) - Chroot Mount Path

- `chroot_mounts` ([][]string) - Chroot Mounts

- `chroot_copy_files` ([]string) - Chroot Copy Files

- `chroot_command_wrapper` (string) - How to run shell commands. This defaults to `{{.Command}}`. This may be
  useful to set if you want to set environmental variables or perhaps run

- `post_mount_commands` ([]string) - As pre_mount_commands, but the commands are executed after mounting the

- `ssh_keys` ([]string) - List of SSH keys by name or id to be added
