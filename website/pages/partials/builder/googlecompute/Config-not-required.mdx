    run Packer on a GCE instance with a service account. Instructions for
    creating the file or using service accounts are above.
    
-   `accelerator_type` (string) - Full or partial URL of the guest accelerator type. GPU accelerators can
    only be used with `"on_host_maintenance": "TERMINATE"` option set.

    `"projects/project_id/zones/europe-west1-b/acceleratorTypes/nvidia-tesla-k80"`
    
-   `accelerator_count` (int64) - Number of guest accelerator cards to add to the launched instance.
    
-   `address` (string) - The name of a pre-allocated static external IP address. Note, must be
    the name and not the actual IP address.
    
-   `disable_default_service_account` (bool) - If true, the default service account will not be used if
    service_account_email is not specified. Set this value to true and omit
    service_account_email to provision a VM with no service account.
    
-   `disk_name` (string) - The name of the disk, if unset the instance name will be used.

    like keys and certificates, that you use to authenticate access to your
    system. [Details](https://cloud.google.com/security/shielded-cloud/shielded-vm)
    
-   `enable_integrity_monitoring` (bool) - Integrity monitoring helps you understand and make decisions about the
    state of your VM instances. Note: integrity monitoring relies on having
    vTPM enabled. [Details](https://cloud.google.com/security/shielded-cloud/shielded-vm)
    
-   `image_name` (string) - The unique name of the resulting image. Defaults to

     }
     ```
    
-   `image_family` (string) - The name of the image family to which the resulting image belongs. You
    can create disks by specifying an image family instead of a specific
    image name. The image family always returns its latest image that is not
    deprecated.
    
-   `image_labels` (map[string]string) - Key/value pair labels to apply to the created image.
    
-   `image_licenses` ([]string) - Licenses to apply to the created image.

    content is to be stored and only accepts 1 value. Always defaults to a nearby regional or multi-regional
    location.
    
    multi-regional example:
    
     ```json
     {
        "image_storage_locations": ["us"]
     }
     ```
    regional example:
    
     ```json
     {
        "image_storage_locations": ["us-east1"]
     }
     ```

    `TERMINATE`. Please see [GCE Instance Scheduling
    Options](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/setting-instance-scheduling-options),
    as not all machine\_types support `MIGRATE` (i.e. machines with GPUs).
    If preemptible is true this can only be `TERMINATE`. If preemptible is
    false, it defaults to `MIGRATE`
    
-   `preemptible` (bool) - If true, launch a preemptible instance.
    
-   `state_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - The time to wait for instance state changes. Defaults to "5m".

    project's default service account unless disable_default_service_account
    is true.
    
-   `source_image_project_id` ([]string) - A list of project IDs to search for the source image. Packer will search the first
    project ID in the list first, and fall back to the next in the list, until it finds the source image.
    
-   `startup_script_file` (string) - The path to a startup script to run on the VM from which the image will
    be made.
    
-   `subnetwork` (string) - The Google Compute subnetwork id or URL to use for the launched
    instance. Only required if the network has been created with custom
    subnetting. Note, the region of the subnetwork must match the region or
    zone in which the VM is launched. If the value is not a URL, it will be
    interpolated to
    `projects/((network_project_id))/regions/((region))/subnetworks/((subnetwork))`
    
-   `tags` ([]string) - Assign network tags to apply firewall rules to VM instance.
    
-   `use_internal_ip` (bool) - If true, use the instance's internal IP instead of its external IP
    during building.
    
-   `use_os_login` (bool) - If true, OSLogin will be used to manage SSH access to the compute instance by
    dynamically importing a temporary SSH key to the Google account's login profile,
    and setting the `enable-oslogin` to `TRUE` in the instance metadata.
    Optionally, `use_os_login` can be used with an existing `ssh_username` and `ssh_private_key_file`
    if a SSH key has already been added to the Google account's login profile - See [Adding SSH Keys](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/managing-instance-access#add_oslogin_keys).
    
    SSH keys can be added to an individual user account
    
    ```shell-session
    $ gcloud compute os-login ssh-keys add --key-file=/home/user/.ssh/my-key.pub
    
    $ gcloud compute os-login describe-profile
    PosixAccounts:
    - accountId: <project-id>
     gid: '34567890754'
     homeDirectory: /home/user_example_com
     ...
     primary: true
     uid: '2504818925'
     username: /home/user_example_com
    sshPublicKeys:
     000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a:

    ```
    
    Or SSH keys can be added to an associated service account
    ```shell-session
    $ gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=<path to service account credentials file (e.g account.json)>
    $ gcloud compute os-login ssh-keys add --key-file=/home/user/.ssh/my-key.pub
    
    $ gcloud compute os-login describe-profile
    PosixAccounts:
    - accountId: <project-id>
     gid: '34567890754'
     homeDirectory: /home/sa_000000000000000000000
     ...

    ```
    
-   `vault_gcp_oauth_engine` (string) - Can be set instead of account_file. If set, this builder will use
    HashiCorp Vault to generate an Oauth token for authenticating against
    Google's cloud. The value should be the path of the token generator
    within vault.
    For information on how to configure your Vault + GCP engine to produce
    Oauth tokens, see https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/gcp
    You must have the environment variables VAULT_ADDR and VAULT_TOKEN set,
    along with any other relevant variables for accessing your vault
    instance. For more information, see the Vault docs:
    https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/commands/#environment-variables
    Example:`"vault_gcp_oauth_engine": "gcp/token/my-project-editor",`
