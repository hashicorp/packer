-   `account_file` (string) - The JSON file containing your account credentials. Not required if you
    run Packer on a GCE instance with a service account. Instructions for
    creating the file or using service accounts are above.
    
-   `accelerator_type` (string) - Full or partial URL of the guest accelerator type. GPU accelerators can
    only be used with `"on_host_maintenance": "TERMINATE"` option set.
    Example:
    `"projects/project_id/zones/europe-west1-b/acceleratorTypes/nvidia-tesla-k80"`
    
-   `accelerator_count` (int64) - Number of guest accelerator cards to add to the launched instance.
    
-   `address` (string) - The name of a pre-allocated static external IP address. Note, must be
    the name and not the actual IP address.
    
-   `disable_default_service_account` (bool) - If true, the default service account will not be used if
    service_account_email is not specified. Set this value to true and omit
    service_account_email to provision a VM with no service account.
    
-   `disk_name` (string) - The name of the disk, if unset the instance name will be used.
    
-   `disk_size` (int64) - The size of the disk in GB. This defaults to 10, which is 10GB.
    
-   `disk_type` (string) - Type of disk used to back your instance, like pd-ssd or pd-standard.
    Defaults to pd-standard.
    
-   `enable_secure_boot` (bool) - Create a Shielded VM image with Secure Boot enabled. It helps ensure that
    the system only runs authentic software by verifying the digital signature
    of all boot components, and halting the boot process if signature verification
    fails. [Details](https://cloud.google.com/security/shielded-cloud/shielded-vm)
    
-   `enable_vtpm` (bool) - Create a Shielded VM image with virtual trusted platform module
    Measured Boot enabled. A vTPM is a virtualized trusted platform module,
    which is a specialized computer chip you can use to protect objects,
    like keys and certificates, that you use to authenticate access to your
    system. [Details](https://cloud.google.com/security/shielded-cloud/shielded-vm)
    
-   `enable_integrity_monitoring` (bool) - Integrity monitoring helps you understand and make decisions about the
    state of your VM instances. Note: integrity monitoring relies on having
    vTPM enabled. [Details](https://cloud.google.com/security/shielded-cloud/shielded-vm)
    
-   `image_name` (string) - The unique name of the resulting image. Defaults to
    `packer-{{timestamp}}`.
    
-   `image_description` (string) - The description of the resulting image.
    
-   `image_encryption_key` (\*CustomerEncryptionKey) - Image encryption key to apply to the created image. Possible values:
    * kmsKeyName -  The name of the encryption key that is stored in Google Cloud KMS.
    * RawKey: - A 256-bit customer-supplied encryption key, encodes in RFC 4648 base64.
    
    example:
    
     ```json
     {
        "kmsKeyName": "projects/${project}/locations/${region}/keyRings/computeEngine/cryptoKeys/computeEngine/cryptoKeyVersions/4"
     }
     ```
    
-   `image_family` (string) - The name of the image family to which the resulting image belongs. You
    can create disks by specifying an image family instead of a specific
    image name. The image family always returns its latest image that is not
    deprecated.
    
-   `image_labels` (map[string]string) - Key/value pair labels to apply to the created image.
    
-   `image_licenses` ([]string) - Licenses to apply to the created image.
    
-   `instance_name` (string) - A name to give the launched instance. Beware that this must be unique.
    Defaults to `packer-{{uuid}}`.
    
-   `labels` (map[string]string) - Key/value pair labels to apply to the launched instance.
    
-   `machine_type` (string) - The machine type. Defaults to "n1-standard-1".
    
-   `metadata` (map[string]string) - Metadata applied to the launched instance.
    
-   `metadata_files` (map[string]string) - Metadata applied to the launched instance. Values are files.
    
-   `min_cpu_platform` (string) - A Minimum CPU Platform for VM Instance. Availability and default CPU
    platforms vary across zones, based on the hardware available in each GCP
    zone.
    [Details](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/specify-min-cpu-platform)
    
-   `network` (string) - The Google Compute network id or URL to use for the launched instance.
    Defaults to "default". If the value is not a URL, it will be
    interpolated to
    projects/((network_project_id))/global/networks/((network)). This value
    is not required if a subnet is specified.
    
-   `network_project_id` (string) - The project ID for the network and subnetwork to use for launched
    instance. Defaults to project_id.
    
-   `omit_external_ip` (bool) - If true, the instance will not have an external IP. use_internal_ip must
    be true if this property is true.
    
-   `on_host_maintenance` (string) - Sets Host Maintenance Option. Valid choices are `MIGRATE` and
    `TERMINATE`. Please see [GCE Instance Scheduling
    Options](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/setting-instance-scheduling-options),
    as not all machine\_types support `MIGRATE` (i.e. machines with GPUs).
    If preemptible is true this can only be `TERMINATE`. If preemptible is
    false, it defaults to `MIGRATE`
    
-   `preemptible` (bool) - If true, launch a preemptible instance.

    hosting the specified zone.
    
-   `scopes` ([]string) - The service account scopes for launched
    instance. Defaults to:
    
    ```json
    [
      "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email",
      "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/compute",
      "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.full_control"
    ]
    ```
    
-   `service_account_email` (string) - The service account to be used for launched instance. Defaults to the
    project's default service account unless disable_default_service_account
    is true.
    
-   `source_image_project_id` ([]string) - A list of project IDs to search for the source image. Packer will search the first
    project ID in the list first, and fall back to the next in the list, until it finds the source image.
    
-   `startup_script_file` (string) - The path to a startup script to run on the VM from which the image will
    be made.
    
-   `subnetwork` (string) - The Google Compute subnetwork id or URL to use for the launched
    instance. Only required if the network has been created with custom
    subnetting. Note, the region of the subnetwork must match the region or
    zone in which the VM is launched. If the value is not a URL, it will be
    interpolated to
    projects/((network_project_id))/regions/((region))/subnetworks/((subnetwork))
    
-   `tags` ([]string) - Assign network tags to apply firewall rules to VM instance.
    
-   `use_internal_ip` (bool) - If true, use the instance's internal IP instead of its external IP
    during building.
    
-   `vault_gcp_oauth_engine` (string) - Can be set instead of account_file. If set, this builder will use
    HashiCorp Vault to generate an Oauth token for authenticating against
    Google's cloud. The value should be the path of the token generator
    within vault.
    For information on how to configure your Vault + GCP engine to produce
    Oauth tokens, see https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/gcp
    You must have the environment variables VAULT_ADDR and VAULT_TOKEN set,
    along with any other relevant variables for accessing your vault
    instance. For more information, see the Vault docs:
    https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/commands/#environment-variables
    Example:`"vault_gcp_oauth_engine": "gcp/token/my-project-editor",`
