- `skip_compaction` (bool) - Virtual disk image is compacted at the end of
  the build process using prl_disk_tool utility (except for the case that
  disk_type is set to plain). In certain rare cases, this might corrupt
  the resulting disk image. If you find this to be the case, you can disable
  compaction using this configuration value.

- `vm_name` (string) - This is the name of the PVM directory for the new
  virtual machine, without the file extension. By default this is
  "packer-BUILDNAME", where "BUILDNAME" is the name of the build.

- `reassign_mac` (bool) - If this is "false" the MAC address of the first
  NIC will reused when imported else a new MAC address will be generated
  by Parallels. Defaults to "false".
