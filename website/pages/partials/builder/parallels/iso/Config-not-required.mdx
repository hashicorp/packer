- `disk_size` (uint) - The size, in megabytes, of the hard disk to create
  for the VM. By default, this is 40000 (about 40 GB).

- `disk_type` (string) - The type for image file based virtual disk drives,
  defaults to expand. Valid options are expand (expanding disk) that the
  image file is small initially and grows in size as you add data to it, and
  plain (plain disk) that the image file has a fixed size from the moment it
  is created (i.e the space is allocated for the full drive). Plain disks
  perform faster than expanding disks. skip_compaction will be set to true
  automatically for plain disks.

- `guest_os_type` (string) - The guest OS type being installed. By default
  this is "other", but you can get dramatic performance improvements by
  setting this to the proper value. To view all available values for this run
  prlctl create x --distribution list. Setting the correct value hints to
  Parallels Desktop how to optimize the virtual hardware to work best with
  that operating system.

- `hard_drive_interface` (string) - The type of controller that the hard
  drives are attached to, defaults to "sata". Valid options are "sata", "ide",
  and "scsi".

- `host_interfaces` ([]string) - A list of which interfaces on the
  host should be searched for a IP address. The first IP address found on one
  of these will be used as `{{ .HTTPIP }}` in the boot_command. Defaults to
  ["en0", "en1", "en2", "en3", "en4", "en5", "en6", "en7", "en8", "en9",
  "ppp0", "ppp1", "ppp2"].

- `skip_compaction` (bool) - Virtual disk image is compacted at the end of
  the build process using prl_disk_tool utility (except for the case that
  disk_type is set to plain). In certain rare cases, this might corrupt
  the resulting disk image. If you find this to be the case, you can disable
  compaction using this configuration value.

- `vm_name` (string) - This is the name of the PVM directory for the new
  virtual machine, without the file extension. By default this is
  "packer-BUILDNAME", where "BUILDNAME" is the name of the build.
