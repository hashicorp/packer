- `prlctl` ([][]string) - Custom prlctl commands to execute
  in order to further customize the virtual machine being created. The value
  of this is an array of commands to execute. The commands are executed in the
  order defined in the template. For each command, the command is defined
  itself as an array of strings, where each string represents a single
  argument on the command-line to prlctl (but excluding prlctl itself).
  Each arg is treated as a configuration
  template, where the Name
  variable is replaced with the VM name. More details on how to use prlctl
  are below.
