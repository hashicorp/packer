- `parallels_tools_guest_path` (string) - The path in the virtual machine to
  upload Parallels Tools. This only takes effect if parallels_tools_mode
  is "upload". This is a configuration
  template that has a single
  valid variable: Flavor, which will be the value of
  parallels_tools_flavor. By default this is `prl-tools-{{.Flavor}}.iso`
  which should upload into the login directory of the user.

- `parallels_tools_mode` (string) - The method by which Parallels Tools are
  made available to the guest for installation. Valid options are "upload",
  "attach", or "disable". If the mode is "attach" the Parallels Tools ISO will
  be attached as a CD device to the virtual machine. If the mode is "upload"
  the Parallels Tools ISO will be uploaded to the path specified by
  parallels_tools_guest_path. The default value is "upload".
