-   `capture_name_prefix` (string) - Capture
    
-   `capture_container_name` (string) - Capture Container Name
-   `shared_image_gallery` (SharedImageGallery) - Use a [Shared Gallery
    image](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/announcing-the-public-preview-of-shared-image-gallery/)
    as the source for this build. *VHD targets are incompatible with this
    build type* - the target must be a *Managed Image*.
    
    ```json
    "shared_image_gallery": {
        "subscription": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000000",
        "resource_group": "ResourceGroup",
        "gallery_name": "GalleryName",
        "image_name": "ImageName",
        "image_version": "1.0.0"
    }
    "managed_image_name": "TargetImageName",
    "managed_image_resource_group_name": "TargetResourceGroup"
    ```
    
-   `shared_image_gallery_destination` (SharedImageGalleryDestination) - The name of the Shared Image Gallery under which the managed image will be published as Shared Gallery Image version.
    
    Following is an example.
    
    ```json
    "shared_image_gallery_destination": {
        "resource_group": "ResourceGroup",
        "gallery_name": "GalleryName",
        "image_name": "ImageName",
        "image_version": "1.0.0",
        "replication_regions": ["regionA", "regionB", "regionC"]

    ```
    
-   `shared_image_gallery_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - How long to wait for an image to be published to the shared image
    gallery before timing out. If your Packer build is failing on the
    Publishing to Shared Image Gallery step with the error `Original Error:
    context deadline exceeded`, but the image is present when you check your
    Azure dashboard, then you probably need to increase this timeout from
    its default of "60m" (valid time units include `s` for seconds, `m` for
    minutes, and `h` for hours.)
    
-   `image_publisher` (string) - PublisherName for your base image. See
    [documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-groups-vm-searching/)
    for details.
    
    CLI example `az vm image list-publishers --location westus`
    
-   `image_offer` (string) - Offer for your base image. See
    [documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-groups-vm-searching/)
    for details.
    
    CLI example
    `az vm image list-offers --location westus --publisher Canonical`
    
-   `image_sku` (string) - SKU for your base image. See
    [documentation](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/resource-groups-vm-searching/)
    for details.
    
    CLI example
    `az vm image list-skus --location westus --publisher Canonical --offer UbuntuServer`
    
-   `image_version` (string) - Specify a specific version of an OS to boot from.
    Defaults to `latest`. There may be a difference in versions available
    across regions due to image synchronization latency. To ensure a consistent
    version across regions set this value to one that is available in all
    regions where you are deploying.
    
    CLI example
    `az vm image list --location westus --publisher Canonical --offer UbuntuServer --sku 16.04.0-LTS --all`
    
-   `image_url` (string) - Specify a custom VHD to use. If this value is set, do
    not set image_publisher, image_offer, image_sku, or image_version.
    
-   `custom_managed_image_resource_group_name` (string) - Specify the source managed image's resource group used to use. If this
    value is set, do not set image\_publisher, image\_offer, image\_sku, or
    image\_version. If this value is set, the value
    `custom_managed_image_name` must also be set. See
    [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-managed-disks-overview#images)
    to learn more about managed images.
    
-   `custom_managed_image_name` (string) - Specify the source managed image's name to use. If this value is set, do
    not set image\_publisher, image\_offer, image\_sku, or image\_version.
    If this value is set, the value
    `custom_managed_image_resource_group_name` must also be set. See
    [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-managed-disks-overview#images)
    to learn more about managed images.
    
-   `location` (string) - Location
-   `vm_size` (string) - Size of the VM used for building. This can be changed when you deploy a
    VM from your VHD. See
    [pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/virtual-machines/)
    information. Defaults to `Standard_A1`.
    
    CLI example `az vm list-sizes --location westus`
    
-   `managed_image_resource_group_name` (string) - Specify the managed image resource group name where the result of the
    Packer build will be saved. The resource group must already exist. If
    this value is set, the value managed_image_name must also be set. See
    documentation to learn more about managed images.
    
-   `managed_image_name` (string) - Specify the managed image name where the result of the Packer build will
    be saved. The image name must not exist ahead of time, and will not be
    overwritten. If this value is set, the value
    managed_image_resource_group_name must also be set. See documentation to
    learn more about managed images.
    
-   `managed_image_storage_account_type` (string) - Specify the storage account
    type for a managed image. Valid values are Standard_LRS and Premium_LRS.
    The default is Standard_LRS.
    
-   `azure_tags` (map[string]\*string) - the user can define up to 15
    tags. Tag names cannot exceed 512 characters, and tag values cannot exceed
    256 characters. Tags are applied to every resource deployed by a Packer
    build, i.e. Resource Group, VM, NIC, VNET, Public IP, KeyVault, etc.
    
-   `plan_id` (string) - Used for creating images from Marketplace images. Please refer to
    [Deploy an image with Marketplace
    terms](https://aka.ms/azuremarketplaceapideployment) for more details.
    Not all Marketplace images support programmatic deployment, and support
    is controlled by the image publisher.
    Plan_id is a string with unique identifier for the plan associated with images.
    Ex plan_id="1-12ab"
    
-   `polling_duration_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - The default PollingDuration for azure is 15mins, this property will override
    that value. See [Azure DefaultPollingDuration](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/go-autorest/autorest#pkg-constants)
    If your Packer build is failing on the
    ARM deployment step with the error `Original Error:
    context deadline exceeded`, then you probably need to increase this timeout from
    its default of "15m" (valid time units include `s` for seconds, `m` for
    minutes, and `h` for hours.)
    
-   `os_type` (string) - If either Linux or Windows is specified Packer will
    automatically configure authentication credentials for the provisioned
    machine. For Linux this configures an SSH authorized key. For Windows
    this configures a WinRM certificate.
    
-   `os_disk_size_gb` (int32) - Specify the size of the OS disk in GB
    (gigabytes). Values of zero or less than zero are ignored.
    
-   `disk_additional_size` ([]int32) - For Managed build the final artifacts are included in the managed image.
    The additional disk will have the same storage account type as the OS
    disk, as specified with the `managed_image_storage_account_type`
    setting.
    
-   `disk_caching_type` (string) - Specify the disk caching type. Valid values
    are None, ReadOnly, and ReadWrite. The default value is ReadWrite.
