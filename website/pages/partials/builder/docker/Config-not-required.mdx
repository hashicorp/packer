<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in builder/docker/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

-   `author` (string) - Set the author (e-mail) of a commit.
    
-   `changes` ([]string) - Dockerfile instructions to add to the commit. Example of instructions
    are CMD, ENTRYPOINT, ENV, and EXPOSE. Example: [ "USER ubuntu", "WORKDIR
    /app", "EXPOSE 8080" ]
    
-   `container_dir` (string) - The directory inside container to mount temp directory from host server
    for work [file provisioner](/docs/provisioners/file). This defaults
    to c:/packer-files on windows and /packer-files on other systems.
    
-   `exec_user` (string) - Username (UID) to run remote commands with. You can also set the group
    name/ID if you want: (UID or UID:GID). You may need this if you get
    permission errors trying to run the shell or other provisioners.
    
-   `privileged` (bool) - If true, run the docker container with the `--privileged` flag. This
    defaults to false if not set.
    
-   `pull` (bool) - If true, the configured image will be pulled using `docker pull` prior
    to use. Otherwise, it is assumed the image already exists and can be
    used. This defaults to true if not set.
    
-   `run_command` ([]string) - An array of arguments to pass to docker run in order to run the
    container. By default this is set to `["-d", "-i", "-t",
    "--entrypoint=/bin/sh", "--", "{{.Image}}"]` if you are using a linux
    container, and `["-d", "-i", "-t", "--entrypoint=powershell", "--",
    "{{.Image}}"]` if you are running a windows container. `{{.Image}}` is a
    template variable that corresponds to the image template option. Passing
    the entrypoint option this way will make it the default entrypoint of
    the resulting image, so running docker run -it --rm  will start the
    docker image from the /bin/sh shell interpreter; you could run a script
    or another shell by running docker run -it --rm  -c /bin/bash. If your
    docker image embeds a binary intended to be run often, you should
    consider changing the default entrypoint to point to it.
    
-   `volumes` (map[string]string) - A mapping of additional volumes to mount into this container. The key of
    the object is the host path, the value is the container path.
    
-   `fix_upload_owner` (bool) - If true, files uploaded to the container will be owned by the user the
    container is running as. If false, the owner will depend on the version
    of docker installed in the system. Defaults to true.
    
-   `windows_container` (bool) - If "true", tells Packer that you are building a Windows container
    running on a windows host. This is necessary for building Windows
    containers, because our normal docker bindings do not work for them.
    
-   `login` (bool) - This is used to login to dockerhub to pull a private base container. For
    pushing to dockerhub, see the docker post-processors
    
-   `login_password` (string) - The password to use to authenticate to login.
    
-   `login_server` (string) - The server address to login to.
    
-   `login_username` (string) - The username to use to authenticate to login.
    
-   `ecr_login` (bool) - Defaults to false. If true, the builder will login in order to pull the
    image from Amazon EC2 Container Registry (ECR). The builder only logs in
    for the duration of the pull. If true login_server is required and
    login, login_username, and login_password will be ignored. For more
    information see the section on ECR.
