- `source_path` (string) - URL of the vagrant box to use, or the name of the vagrant box.
  hashicorp/precise64, ./mylocalbox.box and https://example.com/my-box.box
  are all valid source boxes. If your source is a .box file, whether
  locally or from a URL like the latter example above, you will also need
  to provide a box_name. This option is required, unless you set
  global_id. You may only set one or the other, not both.

- `global_id` (string) - the global id of a Vagrant box already added to Vagrant on your system.
  You can find the global id of your Vagrant boxes using the command
  vagrant global-status; your global_id will be a 7-digit number and
  letter comination that you'll find in the leftmost column of the
  global-status output.  If you choose to use global_id instead of
  source_box, Packer will skip the Vagrant initialize and add steps, and
  simply launch the box directly using the global id.
