<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in builder/lxc/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `output_directory` (string) - The directory in which to save the exported
  tar.gz. Defaults to `output-<BuildName>` in the current directory.

- `container_name` (string) - The name of the LXC container. Usually stored
  in `/var/lib/lxc/containers/<container_name>`. Defaults to
  `packer-<BuildName>`.

- `command_wrapper` (string) - Allows you to specify a wrapper command, such
  as ssh so you can execute packer builds on a remote host. Defaults to
  `{{.Command}}`; i.e. no wrapper.

- `init_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - The timeout in seconds to wait for the the
  container to start. Defaults to 20 seconds.

- `create_options` ([]string) - Options to pass to lxc-create. For
  instance, you can specify a custom LXC container configuration file with
  ["-f", "/path/to/lxc.conf"]. Defaults to []. See man 1 lxc-create for
  available options.

- `start_options` ([]string) - Options to pass to lxc-start. For
  instance, you can override parameters from the LXC container configuration
  file via ["--define", "KEY=VALUE"]. Defaults to []. See
  man 1 lxc-start for available options.

- `attach_options` ([]string) - Options to pass to lxc-attach. For
  instance, you can prevent the container from inheriting the host machine's
  environment by specifying ["--clear-env"]. Defaults to []. See
  man 1 lxc-attach for available options.

- `template_parameters` ([]string) - Options to pass to the given
  lxc-template command, usually located in
  `/usr/share/lxc/templates/lxc-<template_name>`. Note: This gets passed as
  ARGV to the template command. Ensure you have an array of strings, as a
  single string with spaces probably won't work. Defaults to [].

- `target_runlevel` (int) - The minimum run level to wait for the
  container to reach. Note some distributions (Ubuntu) simulate run levels
  and may report 5 rather than 3.
