- `async_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - The time duration to wait for async calls to
  finish. Defaults to 30m.

- `http_get_only` (bool) - Some cloud providers only allow HTTP GET calls
  to their CloudStack API. If using such a provider, you need to set this to
  true in order for the provider to only make GET calls and no POST calls.

- `ssl_no_verify` (bool) - Set to true to skip SSL verification.
  Defaults to false.

- `cidr_list` ([]string) - List of CIDR's that will have access to the new
  instance. This is needed in order for any provisioners to be able to
  connect to the instance. Defaults to [ "0.0.0.0/0" ]. Only required when
  use_local_ip_address is false.

- `create_security_group` (bool) - If true a temporary security group
  will be created which allows traffic towards the instance from the
  cidr_list. This option will be ignored if security_groups is also
  defined. Requires expunge set to true. Defaults to false.

- `disk_offering` (string) - The name or ID of the disk offering used for the
  instance. This option is only available (and also required) when using
  source_iso.

- `disk_size` (int64) - The size (in GB) of the root disk of the new
  instance. This option is only available when using source_template.

- `eject_iso` (bool) - If `true` make a call to the CloudStack API, after loading image to
  cache, requesting to check and detach ISO file (if any) currently
  attached to a virtual machine. Defaults to `false`. This option is only
  available when using `source_iso`.

- `eject_iso_delay` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - Configure the duration time to wait, making sure virtual machine is able
  to finish installing OS before it ejects safely. Requires `eject_iso`
  set to `true` and this option is only available when using `source_iso`.

- `expunge` (bool) - Set to true to expunge the instance when it is
  destroyed. Defaults to false.

- `hypervisor` (string) - The target hypervisor (e.g. XenServer, KVM) for
  the new template. This option is required when using source_iso.

- `instance_name` (string) - The name of the instance. Defaults to
  "packer-UUID" where UUID is dynamically generated.

- `instance_display_name` (string) - The display name of the instance. Defaults to "Created by Packer".

- `project` (string) - The name or ID of the project to deploy the instance
  to.

- `public_ip_address` (string) - The public IP address or it's ID used for
  connecting any provisioners to. If not provided, a temporary public IP
  address will be associated and released during the Packer run.

- `public_port` (int) - The fixed port you want to configure in the port
  forwarding rule. Set this attribute if you do not want to use the a random
  public port.

- `security_groups` ([]string) - A list of security group IDs or

- `prevent_firewall_changes` (bool) - Set to true to prevent network
  ACLs or firewall rules creation. Defaults to false.

- `temporary_keypair_name` (string) - The name of the temporary SSH key pair

- `use_local_ip_address` (bool) - Set to true to indicate that the
  provisioners should connect to the local IP address of the instance.

- `user_data` (string) - User data to launch with the instance. This is a
  template engine; see "User Data" bellow for
  more details. Packer will not automatically wait for a user script to
  finish before shutting down the instance this must be handled in a
  provisioner.

- `user_data_file` (string) - Path to a file that will be used for the user
  data when launching the instance. This file will be parsed as a template
  engine see User Data bellow for more
  details.

- `template_name` (string) - The name of the new template. Defaults to
  `packer-{{timestamp}}` where timestamp will be the current time.

- `template_display_text` (string) - The display text of the new template.
