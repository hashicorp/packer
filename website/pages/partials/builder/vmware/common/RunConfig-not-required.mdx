- `headless` (bool) - Packer defaults to building VMware virtual machines
  by launching a GUI that shows the console of the machine being built. When
  this value is set to true, the machine will start without a console. For
  VMware machines, Packer will output VNC connection information in case you
  need to connect to the console to debug the build process.
  Some users have experienced issues where Packer cannot properly connect
  to a VM if it is headless; this appears to be a result of not ever having
  launched the VMWare GUI and accepting the evaluation license, or
  supplying a real license. If you experience this, launching VMWare and
  accepting the license should resolve your problem.

- `vnc_bind_address` (string) - The IP address that should be
  binded to for VNC. By default packer will use 127.0.0.1 for this. If you
  wish to bind to all interfaces use 0.0.0.0.

- `vnc_port_min` (int) - The minimum and maximum port
  to use for VNC access to the virtual machine. The builder uses VNC to type
  the initial boot_command. Because Packer generally runs in parallel,
  Packer uses a randomly chosen port in this range that appears available. By
  default this is 5900 to 6000. The minimum and maximum ports are
  inclusive.

- `vnc_port_max` (int) - VNC Port Max

- `vnc_disable_password` (bool) - Don't auto-generate a VNC password that
  is used to secure the VNC communication with the VM. This must be set to
  true if building on ESXi 6.5 and 6.7 with VNC enabled. Defaults to
  false.

- `vnc_over_websocket` (bool) - When set to true, Packer will connect to the remote VNC server over a websocket connection
  and any other VNC configuration option will be ignored.
  Remote builds using ESXi 6.7+ allows to connect to the VNC server only over websocket,
  for these the `vnc_over_websocket` must be set to true.

- `insecure_connection` (bool) - Do not validate VNC over websocket server's TLS certificate. Defaults to `false`.
