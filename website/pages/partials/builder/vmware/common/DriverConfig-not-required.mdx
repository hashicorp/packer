- `cleanup_remote_cache` (bool) - When set to true, Packer will cleanup the cache folder where the ISO file is stored during the build on the remote machine.
  By default, this is set to false.

- `fusion_app_path` (string) - Path to "VMware Fusion.app". By default this is
  /Applications/VMware Fusion.app but this setting allows you to
  customize this.

- `remote_type` (string) - The type of remote machine that will be used to
  build this VM rather than a local desktop product. The only value accepted
  for this currently is esx5. If this is not set, a desktop product will
  be used. By default, this is not set.

- `remote_datastore` (string) - The path to the datastore where the VM will be stored
  on the ESXi machine.

- `remote_cache_datastore` (string) - The path to the datastore where supporting files
  will be stored during the build on the remote machine.

- `remote_cache_directory` (string) - The path where the ISO and/or floppy files will
  be stored during the build on the remote machine. The path is relative to
  the remote_cache_datastore on the remote machine.

- `remote_host` (string) - The host of the remote machine used for access.
  This is only required if remote_type is enabled.

- `remote_port` (int) - The SSH port of the remote machine

- `remote_username` (string) - The SSH username used to access the remote machine.

- `remote_password` (string) - The SSH password for access to the remote machine.

- `remote_private_key_file` (string) - The SSH key for access to the remote machine.

- `skip_validate_credentials` (bool) - When Packer is preparing to run a
  remote esxi build, and export is not disable, by default it runs a no-op
  ovftool command to make sure that the remote_username and remote_password
  given are valid. If you set this flag to true, Packer will skip this
  validation. Default: false.
