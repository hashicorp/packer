- `usb_keyboard` (bool) - If set to true, Packer will use USB HID Keyboard scan codes to send the boot command to the VM and
  the [disable_vnc](#disable_vnc) option will be ignored and automatically set to true.
  This option is not supported by hosts running a free VMware license. As alternative please use [vnc_over_websocket](#vnc_over_websocket) instead.
  
  ~> **Note:** The ESXi 6.7+ removes support to VNC. In this case, the `usb_keyboard` or [vnc_over_websocket](#vnc_over_websocket)
  should be set to true in order to send boot command keystrokes to the VM. If both are set, `usb_keyboard` will be ignored
  and set to false.
