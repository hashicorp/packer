<!-- Code generated from the comments of the OutputConfig struct in builder/vmware/common/output_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `output_directory` (string) - This is the path on your local machine (the one running Packer) to the
  directory where the resulting virtual machine will be created.
  This may be relative or absolute. If relative, the path is relative to
  the working directory when packer is executed.
  
  If you are running a remote esx build, the output_dir is the path on your
  local machine (the machine running Packer) to which Packer will export
  the vm if you have `"skip_export": false`. If you want to manage the
  virtual machine's path on the remote datastore, use `remote_output_dir`.
  
  This directory must not exist or be empty prior to running
  the builder.
  
  By default this is output-BUILDNAME where "BUILDNAME" is the name of the
  build.

- `remote_output_directory` (string) - This is the directoy on your remote esx host where you will save your
  vm, relative to your remote_datastore.
  
  This option's default value is your `vm_name`, and the final path of your
  vm will be vmfs/volumes/$remote_datastore/$vm_name/$vm_name.vmx where
  `$remote_datastore` and `$vm_name` match their corresponding template
  options
  
  For example, setting `"remote_output_directory": "path/to/subdir`
  will create a directory `/vmfs/volumes/remote_datastore/path/to/subdir`.
  
  Packer will not create the remote datastore for you; it must already
  exist. However, Packer will create all directories defined in the option
  that do not currently exist.
  
  This option will be ignored unless you are building on a remote esx host.
