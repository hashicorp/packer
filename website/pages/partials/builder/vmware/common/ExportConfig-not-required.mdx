- `format` (string) - Either "ovf", "ova" or "vmx", this specifies the output
  format of the exported virtual machine. This defaults to "ovf".
  Before using this option, you need to install ovftool. This option
  currently only works when option remote_type is set to "esx5".
  Since ovftool is only capable of password based authentication
  remote_password must be set when exporting the VM.

- `ovftool_options` ([]string) - Extra options to pass to ovftool during export. Each item in the array
  is a new argument. The options `--noSSLVerify`, `--skipManifestCheck`,
  and `--targetType` are reserved, and should not be passed to this
  argument. Currently, exporting the build VM (with ovftool) is only
  supported when building on ESXi e.g. when `remote_type` is set to
  `esx5`. See the [Building on a Remote vSphere
  Hypervisor](/docs/builders/vmware-iso#building-on-a-remote-vsphere-hypervisor)
  section below for more info.

- `skip_export` (bool) - Defaults to `false`. When enabled, Packer will not export the VM. Useful
  if the build output is not the resultant image, but created inside the
  VM. Currently, exporting the build VM is only supported when building on
  ESXi e.g. when `remote_type` is set to `esx5`. See the [Building on a
  Remote vSphere
  Hypervisor](/docs/builders/vmware-iso#building-on-a-remote-vsphere-hypervisor)
  section below for more info.

- `keep_registered` (bool) - Set this to true if you would like to keep
  the VM registered with the remote ESXi server. If you do not need to export
  the vm, then also set skip_export: true in order to avoid an unnecessary
  step of using ovftool to export the vm. Defaults to false.

- `skip_compaction` (bool) - VMware-created disks are defragmented and
  compacted at the end of the build process using vmware-vdiskmanager or
  vmkfstools in ESXi. In certain rare cases, this might actually end up
  making the resulting disks slightly larger. If you find this to be the case,
  you can disable compaction using this configuration value. Defaults to
  false. Default to true for ESXi when disk_type_id is not explicitly
  defined and false otherwise.
