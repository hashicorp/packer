<!-- Code generated from the comments of the ExportConfig struct in builder/vmware/common/export_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `format` (string) - Either "ovf", "ova" or "vmx", this specifies the output
  format of the exported virtual machine. This defaults to "ovf" for
  remote (esx) builds, and "vmx" for local builds.
  Before using this option, you need to install ovftool.
  Since ovftool is only capable of password based authentication
  remote_password must be set when exporting the VM from a remote instance.
  If you are building locally, Packer will create a vmx and then
  export that vm to an ovf or ova. Packer will not delete the vmx and vmdk
  files; this is left up to the user if you don't want to keep those
  files.

- `ovftool_options` ([]string) - Extra options to pass to ovftool during export. Each item in the array
  is a new argument. The options `--noSSLVerify`, `--skipManifestCheck`,
  and `--targetType` are used by Packer for remote exports, and should not
  be passed to this argument. For ovf/ova exports from local builds, Packer
  does not automatically set any ovftool options.

- `skip_export` (bool) - Defaults to `false`. When true, Packer will not export the VM. This can
  be useful if the build output is not the resultant image, but created
  inside the VM.

- `keep_registered` (bool) - Set this to true if you would like to keep a remotely-built
  VM registered with the remote ESXi server. If you do not need to export
  the vm, then also set `skip_export: true` in order to avoid unnecessarily
  using ovftool to export the vm. Defaults to false.

- `skip_compaction` (bool) - VMware-created disks are defragmented and
  compacted at the end of the build process using vmware-vdiskmanager or
  vmkfstools in ESXi. In certain rare cases, this might actually end up
  making the resulting disks slightly larger. If you find this to be the case,
  you can disable compaction using this configuration value. Defaults to
  false. Default to true for ESXi when disk_type_id is not explicitly
  defined and false otherwise.
