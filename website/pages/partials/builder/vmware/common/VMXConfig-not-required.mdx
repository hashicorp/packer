<!-- Code generated from the comments of the VMXConfig struct in builder/vmware/common/vmx_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `vmx_data` (map[string]string) - Arbitrary key/values to enter
  into the virtual machine VMX file. This is for advanced users who want to
  set properties that aren't yet supported by the builder.

- `vmx_data_post` (map[string]string) - Identical to vmx_data,
  except that it is run after the virtual machine is shutdown, and before the
  virtual machine is exported.

- `vmx_remove_ethernet_interfaces` (bool) - Remove all ethernet interfaces
  from the VMX file after building. This is for advanced users who understand
  the ramifications, but is useful for building Vagrant boxes since Vagrant
  will create ethernet interfaces when provisioning a box. Defaults to
  false.

- `display_name` (string) - The name that will appear in your vSphere client,
  and will be used for the vmx basename. This will override the "displayname"
  value in your vmx file. It will also override the "displayname" if you have
  set it in the "vmx_data" Packer option. This option is useful if you are
  chaining vmx builds and want to make sure that the display name of each step
  in the chain is unique.
