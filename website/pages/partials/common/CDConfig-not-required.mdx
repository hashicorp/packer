- `cd_files` ([]string) - A list of files to place onto a CD that is attached when the VM is
  booted. This can include either files or directories; any directories
  will be copied onto the CD recursively, preserving directory structure
  hierarchy. Symlinks will have the link's target copied into the directory
  tree on the CD where the symlink was. File globbing is allowed.
  
  Usage example (JSON):
  
  ```json
  "cd_files": ["./somedirectory/meta-data", "./somedirectory/user-data"],
  "cd_label": "cidata",
  ```
  
  Usage example (HCL):
  
  ```hcl
  cd_files = ["./somedirectory/meta-data", "./somedirectory/user-data"]
  cd_label = "cidata"
  ```
  
  The above will create a CD with two files, user-data and meta-data in the
  CD root. This specific example is how you would create a CD that can be
  used for an Ubuntu 20.04 autoinstall.
  
  Since globbing is also supported,
  
  ```hcl
  cd_files = ["./somedirectory/*"]
  cd_label = "cidata"
  ```
  
  Would also be an acceptable way to define the above cd. The difference
  between providing the directory with or without the glob is whether the
  directory itself or its contents will be at the CD root.
  
  Use of this option assums that you have a command line tool isntalled
  that can handle the iso creation. If you are running Packer from an OSX host,
  the required tool is is hdiutil which comes preinstalled.
  On linux hosts, you need to have mkisofs.
  On Windows, you must have oscdimg.exe. oscdimg.exe is part of the
  Windows ADK tooks, downloadable from

- `cd_label` (string) - CD Label
