## Building on a Remote vSphere Hypervisor

In addition to using the desktop products of VMware locally to build virtual
machines, Packer can use a remote VMware Hypervisor to build the virtual
machine.

-> **Note:** Packer supports ESXi 5.1 and above.

Before using a remote vSphere Hypervisor, you need to enable GuestIPHack by
running the following command:

```text
esxcli system settings advanced set -o /Net/GuestIPHack -i 1
```

When using a remote VMware Hypervisor, the builder still downloads the ISO and
various files locally, and uploads these to the remote machine. Packer currently
uses SSH to communicate to the ESXi machine rather than the vSphere API. 
If you want to use vSphere API, see the [vsphere-iso](/docs/builders/vsphere-iso) builder.

Packer also requires VNC to issue boot commands during a build, which may be
disabled on some remote VMware Hypervisors. Please consult the appropriate
documentation on how to update VMware Hypervisor's firewall to allow these
connections. VNC can be disabled by not setting a `boot_command` and setting
`disable_vnc` to `true`.

Please note that you should disable vMotion for the host you intend to run
Packer builds on; a vMotion event will cause the Packer build to fail.

To use a remote VMware vSphere Hypervisor to build your virtual machine, fill in
the required `remote_*` configurations:

- `remote_type` - This must be set to "esx5".

- `remote_host` - The host of the remote machine.

Additionally, there are some optional configurations that you'll likely have to
modify as well:

- `remote_port` - The SSH port of the remote machine

- `remote_datastore` - The path to the datastore where the VM will be stored
  on the ESXi machine.

- `remote_cache_datastore` - The path to the datastore where supporting files
  will be stored during the build on the remote machine.

- `remote_cache_directory` - The path where the ISO and/or floppy files will
  be stored during the build on the remote machine. The path is relative to
  the `remote_cache_datastore` on the remote machine.

- `remote_username` - The SSH username used to access the remote machine.

- `remote_password` - The SSH password for access to the remote machine.

- `remote_private_key_file` - The SSH key for access to the remote machine.

- `format` (string) - Either "ovf", "ova" or "vmx", this specifies the output
  format of the exported virtual machine. This defaults to "ovf".
  Before using this option, you need to install `ovftool`. This option
  currently only works when option remote_type is set to "esx5".
  Since ovftool is only capable of password based authentication
  `remote_password` must be set when exporting the VM.

- `vnc_disable_password` - This must be set to "true" when using VNC with
  ESXi 6.5 or 6.7.
