<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in post-processor/googlecompute-export/post-processor.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `account_file` (string) - The JSON file containing your account credentials.
  If specified, the account file will take precedence over any `googlecompute` builder authentication method.

- `disk_size` (int64) - The size of the export instances disk.
  The disk is unused for the export but a larger size will increase `pd-ssd` read speed.
  This defaults to `200`, which is 200GB.

- `disk_type` (string) - Type of disk used to back the export instance, like
  `pd-ssd` or `pd-standard`. Defaults to `pd-ssd`.

- `machine_type` (string) - The export instance machine type. Defaults to `"n1-highcpu-4"`.

- `network` (string) - The Google Compute network id or URL to use for the export instance.
  Defaults to `"default"`. If the value is not a URL, it
  will be interpolated to `projects/((builder_project_id))/global/networks/((network))`.
  This value is not required if a `subnet` is specified.

- `subnetwork` (string) - The Google Compute subnetwork id or URL to use for
  the export instance. Only required if the `network` has been created with
  custom subnetting. Note, the region of the subnetwork must match the
  `zone` in which the VM is launched. If the value is not a URL,
  it will be interpolated to
  `projects/((builder_project_id))/regions/((region))/subnetworks/((subnetwork))`

- `zone` (string) - The zone in which to launch the export instance. Defaults
  to `googlecompute` builder zone. Example: `"us-central1-a"`

- `vault_gcp_oauth_engine` (string) - Vault GCP Oauth Engine

- `service_account_email` (string) - Service Account Email
