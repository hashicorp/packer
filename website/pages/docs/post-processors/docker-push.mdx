# Docker Push Post-Processor

Type: `docker-push`

The Packer Docker push post-processor takes an artifact from the
[docker-import](/docs/post-processors/docker-import) post-processor and
pushes it to a Docker registry.

## Configuration

This post-processor has only optional configuration:

- `aws_access_key` (string) - The AWS access key used to communicate with
  AWS. [Learn how to set
  this.](/docs/builders/amazon#specifying-amazon-credentials)

- `aws_secret_key` (string) - The AWS secret key used to communicate with
  AWS. [Learn how to set
  this.](/docs/builders/amazon#specifying-amazon-credentials)

- `aws_token` (string) - The AWS access token to use. This is different from
  the access key and secret key. If you're not sure what this is, then you
  probably don't need it. This will also be read from the `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`
  environmental variable.

- `aws_profile` (string) - The AWS shared credentials profile used to
  communicate with AWS. [Learn how to set
  this.](/docs/builders/amazon#specifying-amazon-credentials)

- `ecr_login` (boolean) - Defaults to false. If true, the post-processor will
  login in order to push the image to [Amazon EC2 Container Registry
  (ECR)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/). The post-processor only logs in for
  the duration of the push. If true `login_server` is required and `login`,
  `login_username`, and `login_password` will be ignored.

- `keep_input_artifact` (boolean) - if true, do not delete the docker image
  after pushing it to the cloud. Defaults to true, but can be set to false if
  you do not need to save your local copy of the docker container.

- `login` (boolean) - Defaults to false. If true, the post-processor will
  login prior to pushing. For log into ECR see `ecr_login`.

- `login_username` (string) - The username to use to authenticate to login.

- `login_password` (string) - The password to use to authenticate to login.

- `login_server` (string) - The server address to login to.

-> **Note:** When using _Docker Hub_ or _Quay_ registry servers, `login`
must to be set to `true` and `login_username`, **and** `login_password` must to
be set to your registry credentials. When using Docker Hub, `login_server` can
be omitted.

-> **Note:** If you login using the credentials above, the post-processor
will automatically log you out afterwards (just the server specified).

## Example

For an example of using docker-push, see the section on using generated
artifacts from the [docker builder](/docs/builders/docker).
