# Proxmox Builder

The Proxmox Packer builder is able to create
[Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve) virtual
machines and store them as new Proxmox Virutal Machine images.

Packer is able to target both ISO and existing Cloud-Init images:

- [proxmox-clone](/docs/builders/proxmox/clone) - The proxmox image
  Packer builder is able to create new images for use with
  Proxmox VE. The builder takes a cloud-init enabled virtual machine
  template name, runs any provisioning necessary on the image after
  launching it, then creates a virtual machine template.

- [proxmox-iso](/docs/builders/proxmox/iso) - The proxmox Packer
  builder is able to create new images for use with
  Proxmox VE. The builder takes an ISO source, runs any provisioning
  necessary on the image after launching it, then creates a virtual machine
  template.
