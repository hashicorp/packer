# OpenStack Builder

Type: `openstack`

The `openstack` Packer builder is able to create new images for use with
[OpenStack](http://www.openstack.org). The builder takes a source image, runs
any provisioning necessary on the image after launching it, then creates a new
reusable image. This reusable image can then be used as the foundation of new
servers that are launched within OpenStack. The builder will create temporary
keypairs that provide temporary access to the server while the image is being
created. This simplifies configuration quite a bit.

The builder does _not_ manage images. Once it creates an image, it is up to you
to use it or delete it.

~> **Note:** To use OpenStack builder with the OpenStack Newton (Oct 2016)
or earlier, we recommend you use Packer v1.1.2 or earlier version.

~> **OpenStack Liberty or later requires OpenSSL!** To use the OpenStack
builder with OpenStack Liberty (Oct 2015) or later you need to have OpenSSL
installed _if you are using temporary key pairs_, i.e. don't use
[`ssh_keypair_name`](#ssh_keypair_name) nor
[`ssh_password`](#ssh_password). All major
OS'es have OpenSSL installed by default except Windows. This have been resolved
in OpenStack Ocata(Feb 2017).

~> **Note:** OpenStack Block Storage volume support is available only for
V3 Block Storage API. It's available in OpenStack since Mitaka release (Apr
2016).

## Configuration Reference

There are many configuration options available for the builder. They are
segmented below into two categories: required and optional parameters. Within
each category, the available configuration keys are alphabetized.

In addition to the options listed here, a
[communicator](/docs/templates/communicator) can be configured for this
builder.

### Required:

@include 'builder/openstack/AccessConfig-required.mdx'

@include 'builder/openstack/ImageConfig-required.mdx'

@include 'builder/openstack/RunConfig-required.mdx'

### Optional:

@include 'builder/openstack/AccessConfig-not-required.mdx'

@include 'builder/openstack/ImageConfig-not-required.mdx'

@include 'builder/openstack/RunConfig-not-required.mdx'

### Communicator Configuration

#### Optional:

@include 'helper/communicator/Config-not-required.mdx'

@include 'helper/communicator/SSH-not-required.mdx'

@include 'helper/communicator/SSHInterface-not-required.mdx'

## Basic Example: DevStack

Here is a basic example. This is a example to build on DevStack running in a
VM.

```json
{
  "type": "openstack",
  "identity_endpoint": "http://<devstack-ip>:5000/v3",
  "tenant_name": "admin",
  "domain_name": "Default",
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "<your admin password>",
  "region": "RegionOne",
  "ssh_username": "root",
  "image_name": "Test image",
  "source_image": "<image id>",
  "flavor": "m1.tiny",
  "insecure": "true"
}
```

## Basic Example: Rackspace public cloud

Here is a basic example. This is a working example to build a Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
(Precise Pangolin) on Rackspace OpenStack cloud offering.

```json
{
  "type": "openstack",
  "username": "foo",
  "password": "foo",
  "region": "DFW",
  "ssh_username": "root",
  "image_name": "Test image",
  "source_image": "23b564c9-c3e6-49f9-bc68-86c7a9ab5018",
  "flavor": "2"
}
```

## Basic Example: Private OpenStack cloud

This example builds an Ubuntu 14.04 image on a private OpenStack cloud, powered
by Metacloud.

```json
{
  "type": "openstack",
  "ssh_username": "root",
  "image_name": "ubuntu1404_packer_test_1",
  "source_image": "91d9c168-d1e5-49ca-a775-3bfdbb6c97f1",
  "flavor": "2"
}
```

In this case, the connection information for connecting to OpenStack doesn't
appear in the template. That is because I source a standard OpenStack script
with environment variables set before I run this. This script is setting
environment variables like:

- `OS_AUTH_URL`
- `OS_TENANT_ID`
- `OS_USERNAME`
- `OS_PASSWORD`

This is slightly different when identity v3 is used:

- `OS_AUTH_URL`
- `OS_USERNAME`
- `OS_PASSWORD`
- `OS_DOMAIN_NAME`
- `OS_TENANT_NAME`

This will authenticate the user on the domain and scope you to the project. A
tenant is the same as a project. It's optional to use names or IDs in v3. This
means you can use `OS_USERNAME` or `OS_USERID`, `OS_TENANT_ID` or
`OS_TENANT_NAME` and `OS_DOMAIN_ID` or `OS_DOMAIN_NAME`.

The above example would be equivalent to an RC file looking like this :

```shell
export OS_AUTH_URL="https://identity.myprovider/v3"
export OS_USERNAME="myuser"
export OS_PASSWORD="password"
export OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME="mydomain"
export OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME="mydomain"
```

## Basic Example: Instance with Block Storage root volume

A basic example of Instance with a remote root Block Storage service volume.
This is a working example to build an image on private OpenStack cloud powered
by Selectel VPC.

```json
{
  "type": "openstack",
  "identity_endpoint": "https://api.selvpc.com/identity/v3",
  "tenant_id": "2e90c5c04c7b4c509be78723e2b55b77",
  "username": "foo",
  "password": "foo",
  "region": "ru-3",
  "ssh_username": "root",
  "image_name": "Test image",
  "source_image": "5f58ea7e-6264-4939-9d0f-0c23072b1132",
  "networks": "9aab504e-bedf-48af-9256-682a7fa3dabb",
  "flavor": "1001",
  "availability_zone": "ru-3a",
  "use_blockstorage_volume": true,
  "volume_type": "fast.ru-3a"
}
```

## Notes on OpenStack Authorization

The simplest way to get all settings for authorization against OpenStack is to
go into the OpenStack Dashboard (Horizon) select your _Project_ and navigate
_Project, Access & Security_, select _API Access_ and _Download OpenStack RC
File v3_. Source the file, and select your wanted region by setting environment
variable `OS_REGION_NAME` or `OS_REGION_ID` and
`export OS_TENANT_NAME=$OS_PROJECT_NAME` or
`export OS_TENANT_ID=$OS_PROJECT_ID`.

~> `OS_TENANT_NAME` or `OS_TENANT_ID` must be used even with Identity v3,
`OS_PROJECT_NAME` and `OS_PROJECT_ID` has no effect in Packer.

To troubleshoot authorization issues test you environment variables with the
OpenStack cli. It can be installed with

    $ pip install --user python-openstackclient

### Authorize Using Tokens

To authorize with a access token only `identity_endpoint` and `token` is
needed, and possibly `tenant_name` or `tenant_id` depending on your token type.
Or use the following environment variables:

- `OS_AUTH_URL`
- `OS_TOKEN`
- One of `OS_TENANT_NAME` or `OS_TENANT_ID`

### Authorize Using Application Credential

To authorize with an application credential, only `identity_endpoint`,
`application_credential_id`, and `application_credential_secret` are needed.
Or use the following environment variables:

- `OS_AUTH_URL`
- `OS_APPLICATION_CREDENTIAL_ID`
- `OS_APPLICATION_CREDENTIAL_SECRET`
