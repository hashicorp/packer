# Azure Builder (chroot)

Type: `azure-chroot`

The `azure-chroot` builder is able to build Azure managed disk (MD) images. For
more information on managed disks, see [Azure Managed Disks Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/managed-disks-overview).

The difference between this builder and the `azure-arm` builder is that this
builder is able to build a managed disk image without launching a new Azure VM
for every build, but instead use an already-running Azure VM. This can
dramatically speed up image builds. It also allows for more deterministic image
content and enables some capabilities that are not possible with the
`azure-arm` builder.

> **This is an advanced builder** If you're just getting started with Packer,
> it is recommend to start with the [azure-arm builder](/docs/builders/azure-arm),
> which is much easier to use.

## How Does it Work?

This builder works by creating a new MD from either an existing source or from
scratch and attaching it to the (already existing) Azure VM where Packer is
running. Once attached, a [chroot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot) is set
up and made available to the [provisioners](/docs/provisioners).
After provisioning, the MD is detached, snapshotted and a MD image is created.

Using this process, minutes can be shaved off the image creation process
because Packer does not need to launch a VM instance.

There are some restrictions however:

- The host system must be a similar system (generally the same OS version,
  kernel versions, etc.) as the image being built.
- If the source is a managed disk, it must be made available in the same
  region as the host system.
- The host system SKU has to allow for all of the specified disks to be
  attached.

## Configuration Reference

There are many configuration options available for the builder. We'll start
with authentication parameters, then go over the Azure chroot builder specific
options.

### Authentication options

None of the authentication options are required, but depending on which
ones are specified a different authentication method may be used. See the
[shared Azure builders documentation](/docs/builders/azure) for more
information.

@include 'builder/azure/common/client/Config-not-required.mdx'

### Azure chroot builder specific options

#### Required:

@include 'builder/azure/chroot/Config-required.mdx'

#### Optional:

@include 'builder/azure/chroot/Config-not-required.mdx'

#### Output options:

At least one of these options needs to be specified:

- `image_resource_id` (string) - The managed image to create using this build.

- `shared_image_destination` (object) - The shared image to create using this build.

Where `shared_image_destination` is an object with the following properties:

@include 'builder/azure/chroot/SharedImageGalleryDestination-required.mdx'

@include 'builder/azure/chroot/SharedImageGalleryDestination-not-required.mdx'

And `target_regions` is an array of objects with the following properties:

@include 'builder/azure/chroot/TargetRegion-required.mdx'

@include 'builder/azure/chroot/TargetRegion-not-required.mdx'

## Chroot Mounts

The `chroot_mounts` configuration can be used to mount specific devices within
the chroot. By default, the following additional mounts are added into the
chroot by Packer:

- `/proc` (proc)
- `/sys` (sysfs)
- `/dev` (bind to real `/dev`)
- `/dev/pts` (devpts)
- `/proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc` (binfmt_misc)

These default mounts are usually good enough for anyone and are sane defaults.
However, if you want to change or add the mount points, you may using the
`chroot_mounts` configuration. Here is an example configuration which only
mounts `/prod` and `/dev`:

```json
{
  "chroot_mounts": [
    ["proc", "proc", "/proc"],
    ["bind", "/dev", "/dev"]
  ]
}
```

`chroot_mounts` is a list of a 3-tuples of strings. The three components of the
3-tuple, in order, are:

- The filesystem type. If this is "bind", then Packer will properly bind the
  filesystem to another mount point.

- The source device.

- The mount directory.

## Additional template function

Because this builder runs on an Azure VM, there is an additional template function
available called `vm`, which returns the following VM metadata:

- name
- subscription_id
- resource_group
- location
- resource_id

This function can be used in the configuration templates, for example, use

```text
"{{ vm `subscription_id` }}"
```

to fill in the subscription ID of the VM in any of the configuration options.

## Examples

Here are some examples using this builder.
This builder requires privileged actions, such as mounting disks, running
`chroot` and other admin commands. Usually it needs to be run with root
permissions, for example:

```shell-session
$ sudo -E packer build example.json
```

### Using a VM with a Managed Identity

On a VM with a system-assigned managed identity that has the contributor role
on its own resource group, the following config can be used to create an
updated Debian image:

```json
{
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "azure-chroot",

      "image_resource_id": "/subscriptions/{{vm `subscription_id`}}/resourceGroups/{{vm `resource_group`}}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/images/MyDebianOSImage-{{timestamp}}",
      "source": "credativ:Debian:9:latest"
    }
  ],
  "provisioners": [
    {
      "inline": ["apt-get update", "apt-get upgrade -y"],
      "inline_shebang": "/bin/sh -x",
      "type": "shell"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Using a Service Principal

Here is an example that creates a Debian image with updated packages. Specify
all environment variables (`ARM_CLIENT_ID`, `ARM_CLIENT_SECRET`,
`ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`) to use a service principal.
The identity you choose should have permission to create disks and images and also
to update your VM.
Set the `ARM_IMAGE_RESOURCEGROUP_ID` variable to an existing resource group in the
subscription where the resulting image will be created.
