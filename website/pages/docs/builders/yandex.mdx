# Yandex Compute Builder

Type: `yandex`

The `yandex` Packer builder is able to create
[images](https://cloud.yandex.com/docs/compute/concepts/images) for use with
[Yandex Compute Cloud](https://cloud.yandex.com/docs/compute/)
based on existing images.

## Authentication

Yandex.Cloud services authentication requires one of the following security credentials:

- OAuth token
- File with Service Account Key

### Authentication Using Token

To authenticate with an OAuth token only `token` config key is needed.
Or use the `YC_TOKEN` environment variable.

### Authentication Using Service Account Key File

To authenticate with a service account credential, only `service_account_key_file` is needed.
Or use the `YC_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_FILE` environment variable.

## Basic Example

```json
{
  "type": "yandex",
  "token": "YOUR OAUTH TOKEN",
  "folder_id": "YOUR FOLDER ID",
  "source_image_family": "ubuntu-1804-lts",
  "ssh_username": "ubuntu",
  "use_ipv4_nat": "true"
}
```
