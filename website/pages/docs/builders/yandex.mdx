# Yandex Compute Builder

Type: `yandex`

The `yandex` Packer builder is able to create
[images](https://cloud.yandex.com/docs/compute/concepts/images) for use with
[Yandex Compute Cloud](https://cloud.yandex.com/docs/compute/)
based on existing images.

## Authentication

Builder can authenticate with Yandex.Cloud using one of the following methods:

- OAuth token
- File with Service Account Key
- Service Account assigned to Compute Instance

### Authentication Using Token

To authenticate with an OAuth token only `token` config key is needed.
Or use the `YC_TOKEN` environment variable with proper value. Token you could get [here](https://oauth.yandex.ru/authorize?response_type=token&client_id=1a6990aa636648e9b2ef855fa7bec2fb).

### Authentication Using Service Account Key File

To authenticate with a service account credential, only `service_account_key_file` is needed.
Or use the `YC_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_FILE` environment variable.
The parameter expects a value path to the service account file in json format. Check [documentation](https://cloud.yandex.com/docs/cli/operations/authentication/service-account#auth-as-sa)
about how to create SA and its key.

### Authentication Using a Compute Instance Service Account

Authentication with a Service Account on an instance happens when neither the `token` nor the `service_account_key_file` parameter is set.
To get more information about this kind of authentication check [documentaion](https://cloud.yandex.com/docs/compute/operations/vm-connect/auth-inside-vm).

-> **NB** Do not forget to assigne proper roles to Service Account, if you use this type of auth.

## Basic Example

```json
{
  "type": "yandex",
  "token": "YOUR OAUTH TOKEN",
  "folder_id": "YOUR FOLDER ID",
  "source_image_family": "ubuntu-1804-lts",
  "ssh_username": "ubuntu",
  "use_ipv4_nat": "true"
}
```

## Configuration Reference

Configuration options are organized below into two categories: required and
optional. Within each category, the available options are alphabetized and
described.

In addition to the options listed here, a [communicator](/docs/templates/communicator)
can be configured for this builder.

@include 'builder/yandex/Config-required.mdx'

### Optional:

@include 'builder/yandex/Config-not-required.mdx'

- `ImageID` - ID of the built image.
- `ImageName` - Name of the built image.
- `ImageFamily` - Family of the built image.
- `ImageDescription` - Description of the built image.
- `ImageFolderID` - Folder ID where the built image is stored.
- `SourceImageID` - The source image ID (for example `fd8fjtn3mj2kfe7h6f0r`) used to build the image.
- `SourceImageName` - The source image name (for example `ubuntu-1604-lts-1579200746`) used to build the image.
- `SourceImageDescription` - The source image description (for example `ubuntu 16.04 lts`).
- `SourceImageFamily` - The source image family (for example `ubuntu-1604-lts`).
- `SourceImageFolderID` - The folder ID where source image located (for example `standard-images`).


## Build Shared Information Variables

This builder generates data that are shared with provisioner and post-processor via build function of
[template engine](/docs/templates/engine) for JSON and [contextual variables](/docs/from-1.5/contextual-variables)
for HCL2.

The generated variables available for this builder see above

Usage example:

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="JSON">

```json
"post-processors": [
    {
      "type": "manifest",
      "output": "manifest.json",
      "strip_path": true,
      "custom_data": {
        "source_image_id": "{{ build `SourceImageID` }}"
      }
    }
]
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="HCL2">

```hcl
post-processor "manifest" {
    output = "manifest.json"
    strip_path = true
    custom_data = {
        source_image_id = "${build.SourceImageID}"
    }
}
```
