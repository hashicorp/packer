# HyperV Builder

The HyperV Packer builder is able to create
[Hyper-V](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/solutions/virtualization.aspx)
virtual machines and export them.

- [hyperv-iso](/docs/builders/hyperv-iso) - Starts from an ISO file,
  creates a brand new Hyper-V VM, installs an OS, provisions software within
  the OS, then exports that machine to create an image. This is best for
  people who want to start from scratch.

- [hyperv-vmcx](/docs/builders/hyperv-vmcx) - Clones an an existing
  virtual machine, provisions software within the OS, then exports that
  machine to create an image. This is best for people who have existing base
  images and want to customize them.
