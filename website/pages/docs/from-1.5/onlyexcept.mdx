# Only and Except

`only` and `except` are keywords used to filter what runs in your Packer build,
they can be seen as a command line argument:

`@include 'commands/except.mdx'`

`@include 'commands/only.mdx'`

They can also be seen in a template:

```hcl
build {
  name = "my_build"
  sources [
    "source.amazon-ebs.first-example",
    "source.amazon-ebs.second-example",
  ]

  provisioner "shell-local" {
    only = ["source.amazon-ebs.second-example"]
    inline = ["echo I will only run for the second example source"]
  }

  provisioner "shell-local" {
    except = ["source.amazon-ebs.second-example"]
    inline = ["echo I will never run for the second example source"]
  }
}

build {
  sources [
    "source.amazon-ebs.third-example",
  ]
}

# this file will result in Packer creating three builds named:
#  my_build.amazon-ebs.first-example
#  my_build.amazon-ebs.second-example
#  amazon-ebs.third-example
```

Note that cli arguments can be used with a glob operator, using the previous
configuration:

* `packer build -only 'my_build.*' dir`: will only run the builds in blocks
  named `my_build`.

* `packer build -only '*.amazon-ebs.*' dir`: will only run the builds with a
source of type `amazon-ebs`.

-> Note: In the cli `only` and `except` will match agains **build names** (for
  example:`my_build.amazon-ebs.first-example`) but in a provisioner they will
  match on the **source type** (for example:`source.amazon-ebs.third-example`).
