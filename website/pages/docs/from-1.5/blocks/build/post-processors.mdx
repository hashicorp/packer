# The `post-processors` block

`@include 'from-1.5/beta-hcl2-note.mdx'`

The `post-processors` block allows to define lists of `post-processor`s, that
will run from the artifact of each build.

```hcl
# builds.pkr.hcl
build {
  # ...
  post-processors {
    post-processor "shell-local" { # create an artifice.txt file containing "hello"
      inline = [ "echo hello > artifice.txt" ]
    }
    post-processor "artifice" { # tell packer this is now the new artifact
      files = ["artifice.txt"]
    }
    post-processor "checksum" { # checksum artifice.txt
      checksum_types = [ "md5", "sha512" ] # checksum the artifact
      keep_input_artifact = true           # keep the artifact
    }
  }
  
}
```

The [build.`post-processor` block](/docs/from-1.5/blocks/build/post-processor)
allows to define multiple post-processors that will run from the `Artifact` of
each build. Read the `post-processor` documentation to know how to use a
post-processor.
