# The `post-processors` block

`@include 'from-1.5/beta-hcl2-note.mdx'`

The `post-processors` block allows to define multiple lists of
`post-processors`, that will run from the artifact of each build.

```hcl
# builds.pkr.hcl
build {
  # ...
  post-processors {
    post-processor "checksum" {
      checksum_types = [ "md5", "sha512" ] # checksum the artifact
      keep_input_artifact = true           # keep the artifact
    }
  }
  post-processors {
    post-processor "alicloud-import" { # upload to alicloud
    }
  }
  post-processors {
    post-processor "amazon-import" { # upload to amazon
    }
  }
  post-processors {
    post-processor "googlecompute-import" { # upload to googlecompute
    }
  }
}
```

block](/docs/from-1.5/blocks/build/post-processor) to learn more about and see
some examples of how to use a post-processor.
