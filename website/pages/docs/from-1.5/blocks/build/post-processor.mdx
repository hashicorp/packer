# The `post-processor` block

`@include 'from-1.5/beta-hcl2-note.mdx'`

The `post-processor` block defines how a post-processor is configured.

```hcl
# builds.pkr.hcl
build {
  # ...
  post-processor "checksum" {
    checksum_types = [ "md5", "sha512" ]
    keep_input_artifact = true
  }
}
```

Post-processors run after the image is built by the builder and provisioned by
the provisioner(s). Post-processors are optional, and they can be used to
upload artifacts, re-package, or more. The list of available post-processors
can be found in the [post-processors](/docs/post-processors) section.
