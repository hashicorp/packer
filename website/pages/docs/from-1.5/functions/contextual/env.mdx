# `env` Function

`env` allows you to get the value for an environment variable inside input
variables only. This is the only function that is callable from a variable
block.

```hcl
variable "aws_region" {
  default = env("AWS_DEFAULT_REGION")
}
```

In the previous example, the value of `aws_region` will be what's stored in the
`AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` env var, unless aws_region is also set in a [manner that takes
precedence](/docs/from-1.5/variables#assigning-values-to-build-variables).

When the environment variable is not set at all -- not even with the empty
string -- the value returned by `env` will be an an empty string. It will still
be possible to set it using other means but you could use [custom validation
rules](/docs/from-1.5/variables#custom-validation-rules) to error in that case
to make sure it is set, for example:

```hcl
variable "aws_region" {
  default = env("AWS_DEFAULT_REGION")

  validation {
    condition     = length(var.aws_region) > 0
    error_message = <<EOF
The aws_region var is not set: make sure to at least set the AWS_DEFAULT_REGION env var.
To fix this you could also set the aws_region variable from the arguments, for example:
$ packer build -var=aws_region=us-something-1...
EOF
  }
}
```
