# Transforming Packer v1 config files to HCL2 for Packer v1.5

-> **Note:** Starting from version **1.5.0** Packer can read HCL2 files.

@include 'guides/hcl2-beta-note.mdx'

We will soon provide a programatic way to transpose a v1 buildfile to a v1.5
HCL file. In the meantime we will show how to manually do it.

The following file :

```json
{
  "builders": [
    {
      "ami_name": "packer-test",
      "region": "us-east-1",
      "instance_type": "t2.micro",

      "source_ami_filter": {
        "filters": {
          "virtualization-type": "hvm",
          "name": "ubuntu/images/*ubuntu-xenial-16.04-amd64-server-*",
          "root-device-type": "ebs"
        },
        "owners": ["amazon"],
        "most_recent": true
      },

      "ssh_username": "ubuntu",
      "type": "amazon-ebs"
    }
  ],
  "provisioners": [
    {
      "type": "shell",
      "inline": ["sleep 5"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Becomes:

```hcl
# the source block is what was defined in the builders section and represents a
# reusable way to start a machine. You build your images from that source. All
# sources have a 1:1 correspondance to what currently is a builder. The
# argument name (ie: ami_name) must be unquoted and can be set using the equal
# sign operator (=).
source "amazon-ebs" "example" {
    ami_name = "packer-test"
    region = "us-east-1"
    instance_type = "t2.micro"

    source_ami_filter {
        filters {
          virtualization-type = "hvm"
          name =  "ubuntu/images/*ubuntu-xenial-16.04-amd64-server-*"
          root-device-type = "ebs"
        }
        owners = ["amazon"]
        most_recent = true
    }

    communicator = "ssh"
    ssh_username = "ubuntu"
}

# A build starts sources and runs provisioning steps on those sources.
build {
  sources = [
    # there can be multiple sources per build
    "source.amazon-ebs.example"
  ]

  # All provisioners and post-processors have a 1:1 correspondence to their
  # current layout. The argument name (ie: inline) must to be unquoted
  # and can be set using the equal sign operator (=).
  provisioner "shell" {
    inline = ["sleep 5"]
  }

  # post-processors work too, example: `post-processor "shell-local" {}`.
}

```

### 1:1 correspondence of components ... except :

All fields of builders, provisioners and post-processors have a 1:1
correspondance except for the following:

- builders:

  - aws ami_block_device_mappings
  - aws launch_block_device_mappings
  - aws run_volume_tags
  - alicloud image_disk_mappings
  - osc omi_block_device_mappings
  - osc launch_block_device_mappings
  - proxmox network_adapters
  - proxmox disks
  - tencentcloud data_disks
  - ucloud image_copy_to_mappings

- provisioner:

  - converge module_dirs

- post-processor:
  - alicloud-import image_disk_mappings

One could think that these are defined as "arrays of blocks" - they are in fact
repeatable blocks with the same identifier. For example:

```json
"builders": [
    {
      "type": "amazon-ebs",
      "launch_block_device_mappings": [
        {
          "device_name": "/dev/xvda",
          "volume_size": "20",
          "volume_type": "gp2",
          "delete_on_termination": "true"
        },
        {
          "device_name": "/dev/xvdf",
          "volume_size": "500",
          "volume_type": "gp2",
          "delete_on_termination": "true",
          "encrypted": true
        }
      ],
    }
```

Becomes:

```hcl
source "amazon-ebs" "example" {
    launch_block_device_mappings {
        device_name = "/dev/xvda"
        volume_size = 20
        volume_type = "gp2"
        delete_on_termination = true
    }
    launch_block_device_mappings {
        device_name = "/dev/xvdf"
        volume_size = 500
        volume_type = "gp2"
        delete_on_termination = true
        encrypted = true
    }
```

There is soon going to be a PR to drop the `s` at the end of these fields.

### Deprecation

The current layout of buildfiles will be supported until we and the community
love the new format. Only then the v1 format will be carefully deprecated.

-> **Note:** The HCL parsing library can read JSON and if it is your
configuration format of predilection, you will still be able to do it. You will
have to tweak a few things in order to use future versions of Packer that have
deprecated the current format. Sorry about that! Because the HCL reading code
is generated from the JSON parsing settings; every builder, provisioner and
post-processor setting should look and work the same. A config file transposer
is currently in the making.
