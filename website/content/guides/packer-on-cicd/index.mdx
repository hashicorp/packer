# Build Immutable Infrastructure with Packer in CI/CD

This guide focuses on the following workflow for building immutable
infrastructure. This workflow can be manual or automated and it can be
implemented with a variety of technologies. The goal of this guide is to show
how this workflow can be fully automated using Packer for building images from
a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.

1. [Build Images using Packer in CI/CD](/packer/guides/packer-on-cicd/build-image-in-cicd)
2. [Upload the new image to S3](/packer/guides/packer-on-cicd/upload-images-to-artifact) for future deployment or use during development
3. [Create new Terraform Enterprise runs](/packer/guides/packer-on-cicd/trigger-tfe) to provision new instances with the images
