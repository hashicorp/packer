# Build Images in CI/CD

The following guides from our partners show how to use their services to build
images with Packer.

- [How to Build Immutable Infrastructure with Packer and CircleCI Workflows](https://circleci.com/blog/how-to-build-immutable-infrastructure-with-packer-and-circleci-workflows/)
- [Using Packer and Ansible to Build Immutable Infrastructure in CodeShip](https://blog.codeship.com/packer-ansible/)

The majority of the [Packer Builders](/packer/docs/builders) can run just fine in a
container, a common model used by most CI/CD services. However, while it is
possible to run many builders in containers or nested virtualization, this may
require advanced configuration; examples include the [QEMU
builder](/packer/plugins/builders/qemu) for
[KVM](https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page) or
[Xen](https://www.xenproject.org/), the [VirtualBox
builder](/packer/plugins/builders/virtualbox) for OVA or OVF virtual machines, and the
[VMware builder](/packer/plugins/builders/vmware) for use with VMware products that are
all designed to run on a bare-metal machine or within nested virtualization.

The [Building a VirtualBox Image with Packer in
TeamCity](/packer/guides/packer-on-cicd/build-virtualbox-image) guide shows
how to create a VirtualBox image using TeamCity's support for running scripts
on bare-metal machines.
