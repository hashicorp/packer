# Unattended Installation for Windows

Unattended Windows installation is done via "Answer Files", or "Unattend files".

These files are generally named "autounattend.xml". They are not
Packer-specific tools, though we do make use of them.

If, after following this guide, you're still having issues getting an answer
file working, We recommend you read the official documentation on
[answer files](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/update-windows-settings-and-scripts-create-your-own-answer-file-sxs).

The guide here is hopefully enough to get you started, but isn't a replacement
for the official documentation.

## When To Use an Answer File

If you are installing the Windows Operating System from a mounted iso as part of
your Packer build, you will need to use an Answer file. For example, you're
building an image from scratch using the [vmware-iso](/docs/builders/vmware-iso),
[virtualbox-iso](/docs/builders/virtualbox-iso), or
[hyperv-iso](/docs/builders/hyperv-iso) builders.

If you are not installing the operating system, you won't need to provide an
answer file. If you are using a pre-built image
in a cloud, you don't need to worry about Answer files.

## How to make an Answer File

You can either start from an example answer file from a known repo (take a look
at the examples links below), or you can generate one using an answer file
wizard by selecting New File > New Answer file on a Windows machine.
A comprehensive list of all the options you can set in an answer file can be
found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/customize/desktop/unattend/components-b-unattend)

## Where to put the Answer File

Windows will automatically look for an autounattend.xml file on mounted drives.
Many users use the `floppy_files` option or a secondary mounted iso for
providing the answer file to their iso builders.

You can also specify an unattend file to use by using the /unattend: option when
running Windows Setup (setup.exe) in your `boot_command`.

## What does Packer _need_ the Answer File to do?

Packer needs the Answer File to handle any questions that would normally be
answered interactively during a Windows installation.

If you want to be able to use provisioners, the Answer file must also contain
a script that sets up SSH or WinRM so that Packer can connect to the instance.

Finally, your Packer build will be much smoother if the Answer File handles or
disables windows updates rather than you trying to run them using a Packer
provisioner. This is because the winrm communicator does not handle the
disconnects caused by automatic reboots in Windows updates well, and the
disconnections can fail a build.

## Examples

The chef-maintained bento boxes are a great example of a windows build that
sets up openssh as part of the unattended installation so that Packer can
connect using the SSH communicator. The functioning answer files for every
modern Windows version can be found [here](https://github.com/chef/bento/tree/master/packer_templates/windows/answer_files).

Stefan Scherer's [packer-windows repo](https://github.com/StefanScherer/packer-windows)
is a great example of windows builds that set up WinRM as part of the unattended
installation so that Packer can connect using the winrm communicator:

```json
