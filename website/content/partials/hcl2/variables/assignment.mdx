## Assigning Values to build Variables

Once a variable is declared in your configuration, you can set it:

- Individually, with the `-var foo=bar` command line option.
- In variable definitions (`.pkrvars.hcl` and `.auto.pkrvars.hcl`) files,
  either specified on the command line or automatically loaded.
- As environment variables, for example: `PKR_VAR_foo=bar`
