-> **Note:** This page is about HCL2 in Packer 1.5 and later. HCL2 support for
Packer is still in Beta. Please see the [Packer Issue
Tracker](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/issues/9176) for a list of
supported features. For the old-style stable configuration language see
[template docs](/docs/templates). You can now transform your JSON file into an
HCL2 config file using the [hcl2_upgrade command](/docs/commands/hcl2_upgrade).
