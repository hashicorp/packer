- `output` (string) - The manifest will be written to this file. This defaults to
  `packer-manifest.json`.

- `strip_path` (bool) - Write only filename without the path to the manifest file. This defaults
  to false.

- `strip_time` (bool) - Don't write the `build_time` field from the output.

- `custom_data` (map[string]string) - Arbitrary data to add to the manifest. This is a [template
  engine](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/engine). Therefore, you
  may use user variables and template functions in this field.
