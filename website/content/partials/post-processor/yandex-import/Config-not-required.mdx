- `bucket` (string) - The name of the bucket where the qcow2 file will be uploaded to for import.
  This bucket must exist when the post-processor is run.
  
  If import occurred after Yandex-Export post-processor, artifact already
  in storage service and first paths (URL) is used to, so no need to set this param.

- `object_name` (string) - The name of the object key in `bucket` where the qcow2 file will be copied to import.
  This is a [template engine](/docs/templates/engine).
  Therefore, you may use user variables and template functions in this field.

- `skip_clean` (bool) - Whether skip removing the qcow2 file uploaded to Storage
  after the import process has completed. Possible values are: `true` to
  leave it in the bucket, `false` to remove it. Default is `false`.
