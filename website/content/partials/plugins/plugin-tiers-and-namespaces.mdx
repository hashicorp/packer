## Tiers and Namespaces

Packer plugins are published and maintained by a variety of sources, including
HashiCorp, and the Packer community. We use tiers and badges to
denote the source of a plugin. Additionally, namespaces are used to help users
identify the organization or publisher responsible for the integration, as shown
in the table below.

| Tier                             | Description                                                                                                                   | Namespace                                                   |

| <PluginBadge type="official" />  | Official plugins are owned and maintained by HashiCorp.                                                                       | hashicorp                                                   |
| <PluginBadge type="verified" /> | Verified plugins are owned and maintained by third-party technology partners.

## HCP Packer Badge
<PluginBadge type="hcp_packer_ready" /> is present for plugins that HashiCorp has verified to communicate build status to the HCP Packer registry.
