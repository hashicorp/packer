## Tiers and Namespaces

Packer plugins are published and maintained by a variety of sources, including
HashiCorp, and the Packer community. This website uses tiers and badges to
denote the source of a plugin. Additionally, namespaces are used to help users
identify the organization or publisher responsible for the integration, as shown
in the table below.
