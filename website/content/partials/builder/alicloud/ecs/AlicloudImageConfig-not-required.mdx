<!-- Code generated from the comments of the AlicloudImageConfig struct in builder/alicloud/ecs/image_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `image_version` (string) - The version number of the image, with a length limit of 1 to 40 English
  characters.

- `image_description` (string) - The description of the image, with a length limit of 0 to 256
  characters. Leaving it blank means null, which is the default value. It
  cannot begin with `http://` or `https://`.

- `image_share_account` ([]string) - The IDs of to-be-added Aliyun accounts to which the image is shared. The
  number of accounts is 1 to 10. If number of accounts is greater than 10,
  this parameter is ignored.

- `image_unshare_account` ([]string) - Alicloud Image UN Share Accounts

- `image_copy_regions` ([]string) - Copy to the destination regionIds.

- `image_copy_names` ([]string) - The name of the destination image, [2, 128] English or Chinese
  characters. It must begin with an uppercase/lowercase letter or a
  Chinese character, and may contain numbers, _ or -. It cannot begin with
  `http://` or `https://`.

- `image_encrypted` (boolean) - Whether or not to encrypt the target images,            including those
  copied if image_copy_regions is specified. If this option is set to
  true, a temporary image will be created from the provisioned instance in
  the main region and an encrypted copy will be generated in the same
  region. By default, Packer will keep the encryption setting to what it
  was in the source image.

- `image_force_delete` (bool) - If this value is true, when the target image names including those
  copied are duplicated with existing images, it will delete the existing
  images and then create the target images, otherwise, the creation will
  fail. The default value is false. Check `image_name` and
  `image_copy_names` options for names of target images. If
  [-force](/docs/commands/build#force) option is provided in `build`
  command, this option can be omitted and taken as true.

- `image_force_delete_snapshots` (bool) - If this value is true, when delete the duplicated existing images, the
  source snapshots of those images will be delete either. If
  [-force](/docs/commands/build#force) option is provided in `build`
  command, this option can be omitted and taken as true.

- `image_force_delete_instances` (bool) - Alicloud Image Force Delete Instances

- `image_ignore_data_disks` (bool) - If this value is true, the image created will not include any snapshot
  of data disks. This option would be useful for any circumstance that
  default data disks with instance types are not concerned. The default
  value is false.

- `skip_region_validation` (bool) - The region validation can be skipped if this value is true, the default
  value is false.

- `tags` (map[string]string) - Key/value pair tags applied to the destination image and relevant
  snapshots.

- `tag` ([]{key string, value string}) - Same as [`tags`](#tags) but defined as a singular repeatable block
  containing a `key` and a `value` field. In HCL2 mode the
  [`dynamic_block`](/docs/configuration/from-1.5/expressions#dynamic-blocks)
  will allow you to create those programatically.
