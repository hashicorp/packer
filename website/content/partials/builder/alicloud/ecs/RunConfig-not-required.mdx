- `associate_public_ip_address` (bool) - Associate Public Ip Address

- `zone_id` (string) - ID of the zone to which the disk belongs.

- `io_optimized` (boolean) - Whether an ECS instance is I/O optimized or not. If this option is not
  provided, the value will be determined by product API according to what
  `instance_type` is used.

- `description` (string) - Description

- `force_stop_instance` (bool) - Whether to force shutdown upon device
  restart. The default value is `false`.
  
  If it is set to `false`, the system is shut down normally; if it is set to
  `true`, the system is forced to shut down.

- `disable_stop_instance` (bool) - If this option is set to true, Packer
  will not stop the instance for you, and you need to make sure the instance
  will be stopped in the final provisioner command. Otherwise, Packer will
  timeout while waiting the instance to be stopped. This option is provided
  for some specific scenarios that you want to stop the instance by yourself.
  E.g., Sysprep a windows which may shutdown the instance within its command.
  The default value is false.

- `security_group_id` (string) - ID of the security group to which a newly
  created instance belongs. Mutual access is allowed between instances in one
  security group. If not specified, the newly created instance will be added
  to the default security group. If the default group doesnâ€™t exist, or the
  number of instances in it has reached the maximum limit, a new security
  group will be created automatically.

- `security_group_name` (string) - The security group name. The default value
  is blank. [2, 128] English or Chinese characters, must begin with an
  uppercase/lowercase letter or Chinese character. Can contain numbers, .,
  _ or -. It cannot begin with `http://` or `https://`.

- `user_data` (string) - User data to apply when launching the instance. Note
  that you need to be careful about escaping characters due to the templates
  being JSON. It is often more convenient to use user_data_file, instead.
  Packer will not automatically wait for a user script to finish before
  shutting down the instance this must be handled in a provisioner.

- `user_data_file` (string) - Path to a file that will be used for the user
  data when launching the instance.

- `vpc_id` (string) - VPC ID allocated by the system.

- `vpc_name` (string) - The VPC name. The default value is blank. [2, 128]
  English or Chinese characters, must begin with an uppercase/lowercase
  letter or Chinese character. Can contain numbers, _ and -. The disk
  description will appear on the console. Cannot begin with `http://` or
  `https://`.

- `vpc_cidr_block` (string) - Value options: 192.168.0.0/16 and
  172.16.0.0/16. When not specified, the default value is 172.16.0.0/16.

- `vswitch_id` (string) - The ID of the VSwitch to be used.

- `vswitch_name` (string) - The ID of the VSwitch to be used.

- `instance_name` (string) - Display name of the instance, which is a string of 2 to 128 Chinese or
  English characters. It must begin with an uppercase/lowercase letter or
  a Chinese character and can contain numerals, `.`, `_`, or `-`. The
  instance name is displayed on the Alibaba Cloud console. If this
  parameter is not specified, the default value is InstanceId of the
  instance. It cannot begin with `http://` or `https://`.

- `internet_charge_type` (string) - Internet charge type, which can be
  `PayByTraffic` or `PayByBandwidth`. Optional values:
  -   `PayByBandwidth`
  -   `PayByTraffic`
  
  If this parameter is not specified, the default value is `PayByBandwidth`.
  For the regions out of China, currently only support `PayByTraffic`, you
  must set it manfully.

- `internet_max_bandwidth_out` (int) - Maximum outgoing bandwidth to the
  public network, measured in Mbps (Mega bits per second).
  
  Value range:
  -   `PayByBandwidth`: \[0, 100\]. If this parameter is not specified, API
      automatically sets it to 0 Mbps.
  -   `PayByTraffic`: \[1, 100\]. If this parameter is not specified, an
      error is returned.

- `wait_snapshot_ready_timeout` (int) - Timeout of creating snapshot(s).
  The default timeout is 3600 seconds if this option is not set or is set
  to 0. For those disks containing lots of data, it may require a higher
  timeout value.

- `ssh_private_ip` (bool) - If this value is true, packer will connect to
  the ECS created through private ip instead of allocating a public ip or an
  EIP. The default value is false.
