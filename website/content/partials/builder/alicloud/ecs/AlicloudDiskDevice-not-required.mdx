- `disk_name` (string) - The value of disk name is blank by default. [2,
  128] English or Chinese characters, must begin with an
  uppercase/lowercase letter or Chinese character. Can contain numbers,
  ., _ and -. The disk name will appear on the console. It cannot
  begin with `http://` or `https://`.

- `disk_category` (string) - Category of the system disk. Optional values are:
      -   cloud - general cloud disk
      -   cloud_efficiency - efficiency cloud disk
      -   cloud_ssd - cloud SSD

- `disk_size` (int) - Size of the system disk, measured in GiB. Value
  range: [20, 500]. The specified value must be equal to or greater
  than max{20, ImageSize}. Default value: max{40, ImageSize}.

- `disk_snapshot_id` (string) - Snapshots are used to create the data
  disk After this parameter is specified, Size is ignored. The actual
  size of the created disk is the size of the specified snapshot.
  This field is only used in the ECSImagesDiskMappings option, not
  the ECSSystemDiskMapping option.

- `disk_description` (string) - The value of disk description is blank by
  default. [2, 256] characters. The disk description will appear on the
  console. It cannot begin with `http://` or `https://`.

- `disk_delete_with_instance` (bool) - Whether or not the disk is

- `disk_device` (string) - Device information of the related instance:
  such as /dev/xvdb It is null unless the Status is In_use.

- `disk_encrypted` (boolean) - Whether or not to encrypt the data disk.
  If this option is set to true, the data disk will be encryped and
  corresponding snapshot in the target image will also be encrypted. By
  default, if this is an extra data disk, Packer will not encrypt the
  data disk. Otherwise, Packer will keep the encryption setting to what
  it was in the source image. Please refer to Introduction of ECS disk
  encryption for more details.
