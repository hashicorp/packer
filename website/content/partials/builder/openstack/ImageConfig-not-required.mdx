<!-- Code generated from the comments of the ImageConfig struct in builder/openstack/image_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `metadata` (map[string]string) - Glance metadata that will be applied to the image.

- `image_visibility` (imageservice.ImageVisibility) - One of "public", "private", "shared", or "community".

- `image_members` ([]string) - List of members to add to the image after creation. An image member is
  usually a project (also called the "tenant") with whom the image is
  shared.

- `image_auto_accept_members` (bool) - When true, perform the image accept so the members can see the image in their
  project. This requires a user with priveleges both in the build project and
  in the members provided. Defaults to false.

- `image_disk_format` (string) - Disk format of the resulting image. This option works if
  use_blockstorage_volume is true.

- `image_tags` ([]string) - List of tags to add to the image after creation.

- `image_min_disk` (int) - Minimum disk size needed to boot image, in gigabytes.

- `skip_create_image` (bool) - Skip creating the image. Useful for setting to `true` during a build test stage. Defaults to `false`.
