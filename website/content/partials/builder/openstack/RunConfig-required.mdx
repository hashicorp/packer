- `source_image` (string) - The ID or full URL to the base image to use. This is the image that will
  be used to launch a new server and provision it. Unless you specify
  completely custom SSH settings, the source image must have cloud-init
  installed so that the keypair gets assigned properly.

- `source_image_name` (string) - The name of the base image to use. This is an alternative way of
  providing source_image and only either of them can be specified.

- `external_source_image_url` (string) - The URL of an external base image to use. This is an alternative way of
  providing source_image and only either of them can be specified.

- `source_image_filter` (ImageFilter) - Filters used to populate filter options. Example:
  
  ```json
  {
      "source_image_filter": {
          "filters": {
              "name": "ubuntu-16.04",
              "visibility": "protected",
              "owner": "d1a588cf4b0743344508dc145649372d1",
              "tags": ["prod", "ready"],
              "properties": {
                  "os_distro": "ubuntu"
              }
          },
          "most_recent": true
      }
  }
  ```
  
  This selects the most recent production Ubuntu 16.04 shared to you by
  the given owner. NOTE: This will fail unless *exactly* one image is
  returned, or `most_recent` is set to true. In the example of multiple
  returned images, `most_recent` will cause this to succeed by selecting
  the newest image of the returned images.
  
  -   `filters` (map of strings) - filters used to select a
  `source_image`.
      NOTE: This will fail unless *exactly* one image is returned, or
      `most_recent` is set to true. Of the filters described in
      [ImageService](https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/image/v2/), the
      following are valid:
  
      -   name (string)
      -   owner (string)
      -   tags (array of strings)
      -   visibility (string)
      -   properties (map of strings to strings) (fields that can be set
          with `openstack image set --property key=value`)
  
  -   `most_recent` (boolean) - Selects the newest created image when
  true.
      This is most useful for selecting a daily distro build.
  
  You may set use this in place of `source_image` If `source_image_filter`
  is provided alongside `source_image`, the `source_image` will override
  the filter. The filter will not be used in this case.

- `flavor` (string) - The ID, name, or full URL for the desired flavor for the server to be
  created.
