<!-- Code generated from the comments of the DiskConfig struct in builder/vmware/common/disk_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `disk_additional_size` ([]uint) - The size(s) of any additional
  hard disks for the VM in megabytes. If this is not specified then the VM
  will only contain a primary hard disk. The builder uses expandable, not
  fixed-size virtual hard disks, so the actual file representing the disk will
  not use the full size unless it is full.

- `disk_adapter_type` (string) - The adapter type of the VMware virtual disk to create. This option is
  for advanced usage, modify only if you know what you're doing. Some of
  the options you can specify are `ide`, `sata`, `nvme` or `scsi` (which
  uses the "lsilogic" scsi interface by default). If you specify another
  option, Packer will assume that you're specifying a `scsi` interface of
  that specified type. For more information, please consult [Virtual Disk
  Manager User's Guide](http://www.vmware.com/pdf/VirtualDiskManager.pdf)
  for desktop VMware clients. For ESXi, refer to the proper ESXi
  documentation.

- `vmdk_name` (string) - The filename of the virtual disk that'll be created,
  without the extension. This defaults to "disk".

- `disk_type_id` (string) - The type of VMware virtual disk to create. This
  option is for advanced usage.
  
    For desktop VMware clients:
  
    Type ID | Description
    ------- | ---
    `0`     | Growable virtual disk contained in a single file (monolithic sparse).
    `1`     | Growable virtual disk split into 2GB files (split sparse).
    `2`     | Preallocated virtual disk contained in a single file (monolithic flat).
    `3`     | Preallocated virtual disk split into 2GB files (split flat).
    `4`     | Preallocated virtual disk compatible with ESX server (VMFS flat).
    `5`     | Compressed disk optimized for streaming.
  
    The default is `1`.
  
    For ESXi, this defaults to `zeroedthick`. The available options for ESXi
    are: `zeroedthick`, `eagerzeroedthick`, `thin`. `rdm:dev`, `rdmp:dev`,
    `2gbsparse` are not supported. Due to default disk compaction, when using
    `zeroedthick` or `eagerzeroedthick` set `skip_compaction` to `true`.
  
    For more information, please consult the [Virtual Disk Manager User's
    Guide](https://www.vmware.com/pdf/VirtualDiskManager.pdf) for desktop
    VMware clients. For ESXi, refer to the proper ESXi documentation.
