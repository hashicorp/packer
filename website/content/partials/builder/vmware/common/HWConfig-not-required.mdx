<!-- Code generated from the comments of the HWConfig struct in builder/vmware/common/hw_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `cpus` (int) - The number of cpus to use when building the VM.

- `memory` (int) - The amount of memory to use when building the VM in megabytes.

- `cores` (int) - The number of cores per socket to use when building the VM. This
  corresponds to the cpuid.coresPerSocket option in the .vmx file.

- `network` (string) - This is the network type that the virtual machine will be created with.
  This can be one of the generic values that map to a device such as
  hostonly, nat, or bridged. If the network is not one of these values,
  then it is assumed to be a VMware network device. (VMnet0..x)

- `network_adapter_type` (string) - This is the ethernet adapter type the the virtual machine will be
  created with. By default the `e1000` network adapter type will be used
  by Packer. For more information, please consult [Choosing a network
  adapter for your virtual
  machine](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/1001805) for desktop VMware
  clients. For ESXi, refer to the proper ESXi documentation.

- `network_name` (string) - The custom name of the network. Sets the vmx value "ethernet0.networkName"

- `sound` (bool) - Specify whether to enable VMware's virtual soundcard device when
  building the VM. Defaults to false.

- `usb` (bool) - Enable VMware's USB bus when building the guest VM. Defaults to false.
  To enable usage of the XHCI bus for USB 3 (5 Gbit/s), one can use the
  vmx_data option to enable it by specifying true for the usb_xhci.present
  property.

- `serial` (string) - This specifies a serial port to add to the VM. It has a format of
  `Type:option1,option2,...`. The field `Type` can be one of the following
  values: `FILE`, `DEVICE`, `PIPE`, `AUTO`, or `NONE`.
  
  * `FILE:path(,yield)` - Specifies the path to the local file to be used
    as the serial port.
  
    * `yield` (bool) - This is an optional boolean that specifies
      whether the vm should yield the cpu when polling the port. By
      default, the builder will assume this as `FALSE`.
  
  * `DEVICE:path(,yield)` - Specifies the path to the local device to be
  Â   used as the serial port. If `path` is empty, then default to the first
    serial port.
  
    * `yield` (bool) - This is an optional boolean that specifies
      whether the vm should yield the cpu when polling the port. By
      default, the builder will assume this as `FALSE`.
  
  * `PIPE:path,endpoint,host(,yield)` - Specifies to use the named-pipe
    "path" as a serial port. This has a few options that determine how the
    VM should use the named-pipe.
  
    * `endpoint` (string) - Chooses the type of the VM-end, which can be
      either a `client` or `server`.
  
    * `host` (string)     - Chooses the type of the host-end, which can
      be either `app` (application) or `vm` (another virtual-machine).
  
    * `yield` (bool)      - This is an optional boolean that specifies
      whether the vm should yield the cpu when polling the port. By
      default, the builder will assume this as `FALSE`.
  
  * `AUTO:(yield)` - Specifies to use auto-detection to determine the
    serial port to use. This has one option to determine how the VM should
    support the serial port.
  
    * `yield` (bool) - This is an optional boolean that specifies
      whether the vm should yield the cpu when polling the port. By
      default, the builder will assume this as `FALSE`.
  
  * `NONE` - Specifies to not use a serial port. (default)

- `parallel` (string) - This specifies a parallel port to add to the VM. It has the format of
  `Type:option1,option2,...`. Type can be one of the following values:
  `FILE`, `DEVICE`, `AUTO`, or `NONE`.
  
  * `FILE:path` 		- Specifies the path to the local file to be used
    for the parallel port.
  
  * `DEVICE:path`	 	- Specifies the path to the local device to be used
    for the parallel port.
  
  * `AUTO:direction`   - Specifies to use auto-detection to determine the
    parallel port. Direction can be `BI` to specify bidirectional
    communication or `UNI` to specify unidirectional communication.
  
  * `NONE` 			- Specifies to not use a parallel port. (default)
