- `tools_upload_flavor` (string) - The flavor of the VMware Tools ISO to
  upload into the VM. Valid values are darwin, linux, and windows. By
  default, this is empty, which means VMware tools won't be uploaded.

- `tools_upload_path` (string) - The path in the VM to upload the VMware tools. This only takes effect if
  `tools_upload_flavor` is non-empty. This is a [configuration
  template](/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/engine) that has a single valid variable:
  `Flavor`, which will be the value of `tools_upload_flavor`. By default
  the upload path is set to `{{.Flavor}}.iso`. This setting is not used
  when `remote_type` is `esx5`.

- `tools_source_path` (string) - The path on your local machine to fetch the vmware tools from. If this
  is not set but the tools_upload_flavor is set, then Packer will try to
  load the VMWare tools from the VMWare installation directory.
