<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in builder/vmware/iso/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `disk_size` (uint) - The size of the hard disk for the VM in megabytes.
  The builder uses expandable, not fixed-size virtual hard disks, so the
  actual file representing the disk will not use the full size unless it
  is full. By default this is set to 40000 (about 40 GB).

- `cdrom_adapter_type` (string) - The adapter type (or bus) that will be used
  by the cdrom device. This is chosen by default based on the disk adapter
  type. VMware tends to lean towards ide for the cdrom device unless
  sata is chosen for the disk adapter and so Packer attempts to mirror
  this logic. This field can be specified as either ide, sata, or scsi.

- `guest_os_type` (string) - The guest OS type being installed. This will be
  set in the VMware VMX. By default this is other. By specifying a more
  specific OS type, VMware may perform some optimizations or virtual hardware
  changes to better support the operating system running in the
  virtual machine. Valid values differ by platform and version numbers, and may
  not match other VMware API's representation of the guest OS names. Consult your
  platform for valid values.

- `version` (string) - The [vmx hardware
  version](http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=1003746)
  for the new virtual machine. Only the default value has been tested, any
  other value is experimental. Default value is `9`.

- `vm_name` (string) - This is the name of the VMX file for the new virtual
  machine, without the file extension. By default this is packer-BUILDNAME,
  where "BUILDNAME" is the name of the build.

- `vmx_disk_template_path` (string) - VMX Disk Template Path

- `vmx_template_path` (string) - Path to a [configuration template](/docs/templates/engine) that
  defines the contents of the virtual machine VMX file for VMware. The
  engine has access to the template variables `{{ .DiskNumber }}` and
  `{{ .DiskName }}`.
  
  This is for **advanced users only** as this can render the virtual machine
  non-functional. See below for more information. For basic VMX
  modifications, try `vmx_data` first.
