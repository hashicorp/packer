- `linked` (bool) - By default Packer creates a 'full' clone of the virtual machine
  specified in source_path. The resultant virtual machine is fully
  independant from the parent it was cloned from.
  
  Setting linked to true instead causes Packer to create the virtual
  machine as a 'linked' clone. Linked clones use and require ongoing
  access to the disks of the parent virtual machine. The benefit of a
  linked clone is that the clones virtual disk is typically very much
  smaller than would be the case for a full clone. Additionally, the
  cloned virtual machine can also be created much faster. Creating a
  linked clone will typically only be of benefit in some advanced build
  scenarios. Most users will wish to create a full clone instead. Defaults
  to false.

- `attach_snapshot` (string) - Default to `null/empty`. The name of an
  **existing** snapshot to which the builder shall attach the VM before
  starting it. If no snapshot is specified the builder will simply start the
  VM from it's current state i.e. snapshot.

- `vm_name` (string) - This is the name of the VMX file for the new virtual
  machine, without the file extension. By default this is packer-BUILDNAME,
  where "BUILDNAME" is the name of the build.
