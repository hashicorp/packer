- `use_iap` (bool) - Whether to use an IAP proxy.
  Prerequisites and limitations for using IAP:
  - You must manually enable the IAP API in the Google Cloud console.
  - You must have the gcloud sdk installed on the computer running Packer.
  - You must be using a Service Account with a credentials file (using the
  	 account_file option in the Packer template)
  - You must add the given service account to project level IAP permissions
    in https://console.cloud.google.com/security/iap. To do so, click
    "project" > "SSH and TCP resoures" > "All Tunnel Resources" >
    "Add Member". Then add your service account and choose the role
    "IAP-secured Tunnel User" and add any conditions you may care about.

  Default: "/bin/sh"
