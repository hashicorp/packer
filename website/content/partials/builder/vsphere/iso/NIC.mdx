Defines a Network Adapter

Example that creates two network adapters:

In JSON:
```json
  "network_adapters": [
    {
      "network": "VM Network",
      "network_card": "vmxnet3"
    },
    {
      "network": "OtherNetwork",
      "network_card": "vmxnet3"
    }
  ],
```
In HCL2:
```hcl
  network_adapters {
      network = "VM Network"
      network_card = "vmxnet3"
  }
  network_adapters {
      network = "OtherNetwork"
      network_card = "vmxnet3"
  }
```
