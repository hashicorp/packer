- `properties` (map[string]string) - Set values for the available vApp Properties to supply configuration parameters to a virtual machine cloned from
  a template that came from an imported OVF or OVA file.
  
  -> **Note:** The only supported usage path for vApp properties is for existing user-configurable keys.
  These generally come from an existing template that was created from an imported OVF or OVA file.
  You cannot set values for vApp properties on virtual machines created from scratch,
  virtual machines lacking a vApp configuration, or on property keys that do not exist.
