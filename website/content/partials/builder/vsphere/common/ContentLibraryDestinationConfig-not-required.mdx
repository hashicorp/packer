<!-- Code generated from the comments of the ContentLibraryDestinationConfig struct in builder/vsphere/common/step_import_to_content_library.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `library` (string) - Name of the library in which the new library item containing the template should be created/updated.
  The Content Library should be of type Local to allow deploying virtual machines.

- `name` (string) - Name of the library item that will be created or updated.
  For VM templates, the name of the item should be different from [vm_name](#vm_name) and
  the default is [vm_name](#vm_name) + timestamp when not set. VM templates will be always imported to a new library item.
  For OVF templates, the name defaults to [vm_name](#vm_name) when not set, and if an item with the same name already
  exists it will be then updated with the new OVF template, otherwise a new item will be created.
  
  ~> **Note**: It's not possible to update existing library items with a new VM template. If updating an existing library
  item is necessary, use an OVF template instead by setting the [ovf](#ovf) option as `true`.

- `description` (string) - Description of the library item that will be created.
  This option is not used when importing OVF templates.
  Defaults to "Packer imported [vm_name](#vm_name) VM template".

- `cluster` (string) - Cluster onto which the virtual machine template should be placed.
  If cluster and resource_pool are both specified, resource_pool must belong to cluster.
  If cluster and host are both specified, host must be a member of cluster.
  This option is not used when importing OVF templates.
  Defaults to [cluster](#cluster).

- `folder` (string) - Virtual machine folder into which the virtual machine template should be placed.
  This option is not used when importing OVF templates.
  Defaults to the same folder as the source virtual machine.

- `host` (string) - Host onto which the virtual machine template should be placed.
  If host and resource_pool are both specified, resource_pool must belong to host.
  If host and cluster are both specified, host must be a member of cluster.
  This option is not used when importing OVF templates.
  Defaults to [host](#host).

- `resource_pool` (string) - Resource pool into which the virtual machine template should be placed.
  Defaults to [resource_pool](#resource_pool). if [resource_pool](#resource_pool) is also unset,
  the system will attempt to choose a suitable resource pool for the virtual machine template.

- `datastore` (string) - The datastore for the virtual machine template's configuration and log files.
  This option is not used when importing OVF templates.
  Defaults to the storage backing associated with the library specified by library.

- `destroy` (bool) - If set to true, the VM will be destroyed after deploying the template to the Content Library.
  Defaults to `false`.

- `ovf` (bool) - When set to true, Packer will import and OVF template to the content library item. Defaults to `false`.
