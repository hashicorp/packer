- `ip_wait_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - Amount of time to wait for VM's IP, similar to 'ssh_timeout'.
  Defaults to 30m (30 minutes). See the Golang
  [ParseDuration](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration) documentation
  for full details.

- `ip_settle_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - Amount of time to wait for VM's IP to settle down, sometimes VM may
  report incorrect IP initially, then its recommended to set that
  parameter to apx. 2 minutes. Examples 45s and 10m. Defaults to
  5s(5 seconds). See the Golang
  [ParseDuration](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration) documentation
   for full details.

- `ip_wait_address` (\*string) - Set this to a CIDR address to cause the service to wait for an address that is contained in
  this network range. Defaults to "0.0.0.0/0" for any ipv4 address. Examples include:
  
  * empty string ("") - remove all filters
  * `0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0/0` - allow only ipv6 addresses
  * `192.168.1.0/24` - only allow ipv4 addresses from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254
