- `output_directory` (string) - This setting specifies the directory that
  artifacts from the build, such as the virtual machine files and disks,
  will be output to. The path to the directory may be relative or
  absolute. If relative, the path is relative to the working directory
  packer is executed from. This directory must not exist or, if
  created, must be empty prior to running the builder. By default this is
  "output-BUILDNAME" where "BUILDNAME" is the name of the build.

- `directory_permission` (os.FileMode) - The permissions to apply to the "output_directory", and to any parent
  directories that get created for output_directory.  By default this is
  "0750". You should express the permission as quoted string with a
  leading zero such as "0755" in JSON file, because JSON does not support
  octal value. In Unix-like OS, the actual permission may differ from
  this value because of umask.
