<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in builder/amazon/chroot/builder.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `ami_block_device_mappings` (awscommon.BlockDevices) - Add one or more [block device
  mappings](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/block-device-mapping-concepts.html)
  to the AMI. If this field is populated, and you are building from an
  existing source image, the block device mappings in the source image
  will be overwritten. This means you must have a block device mapping
  entry for your root volume, `root_volume_size` and `root_device_name`.
  See the [BlockDevices](#block-devices-configuration) documentation for
  fields.

- `chroot_mounts` ([][]string) - This is a list of devices to mount into the chroot environment. This
  configuration parameter requires some additional documentation which is
  in the Chroot Mounts section. Please read that section for more
  information on how to use this.

- `command_wrapper` (string) - How to run shell commands. This defaults to `{{.Command}}`. This may be
  useful to set if you want to set environmental variables or perhaps run
  it with sudo or so on. This is a configuration template where the
  .Command variable is replaced with the command to be run. Defaults to
  `{{.Command}}`.

- `copy_files` ([]string) - Paths to files on the running EC2 instance that will be copied into the
  chroot environment prior to provisioning. Defaults to /etc/resolv.conf
  so that DNS lookups work. Pass an empty list to skip copying
  /etc/resolv.conf. You may need to do this if you're building an image
  that uses systemd.

- `device_path` (string) - The path to the device where the root volume of the source AMI will be
  attached. This defaults to "" (empty string), which forces Packer to
  find an open device automatically.

- `nvme_device_path` (string) - When we call the mount command (by default mount -o device dir), the
  string provided in nvme_mount_path will replace device in that command.
  When this option is not set, device in that command will be something
  like /dev/sdf1, mirroring the attached device name. This assumption
  works for most instances but will fail with c5 and m5 instances. In
  order to use the chroot builder with c5 and m5 instances, you must
  manually set nvme_device_path and device_path.

- `from_scratch` (bool) - Build a new volume instead of starting from an existing AMI root volume
  snapshot. Default false. If true, source_ami/source_ami_filter are no
  longer used and the following options become required:
  ami_virtualization_type, pre_mount_commands and root_volume_size.

- `mount_options` ([]string) - Options to supply the mount command when mounting devices. Each option
  will be prefixed with -o and supplied to the mount command ran by
  Packer. Because this command is ran in a shell, user discretion is
  advised. See this manual page for the mount command for valid file
  system specific options.

- `mount_partition` (string) - The partition number containing the / partition. By default this is the
  first partition of the volume, (for example, xvda1) but you can
  designate the entire block device by setting "mount_partition": "0" in
  your config, which will mount xvda instead.

- `mount_path` (string) - The path where the volume will be mounted. This is where the chroot
  environment will be. This defaults to
  `/mnt/packer-amazon-chroot-volumes/{{.Device}}`. This is a configuration
  template where the .Device variable is replaced with the name of the
  device where the volume is attached.

- `post_mount_commands` ([]string) - As pre_mount_commands, but the commands are executed after mounting the
  root device and before the extra mount and copy steps. The device and
  mount path are provided by `{{.Device}}` and `{{.MountPath}}`.

- `pre_mount_commands` ([]string) - A series of commands to execute after attaching the root volume and
  before mounting the chroot. This is not required unless using
  from_scratch. If so, this should include any partitioning and filesystem
  creation commands. The path to the device is provided by `{{.Device}}`.

- `root_device_name` (string) - The root device name. For example, xvda.

- `root_volume_size` (int64) - The size of the root volume in GB for the chroot environment and the
  resulting AMI. Default size is the snapshot size of the source_ami
  unless from_scratch is true, in which case this field must be defined.

- `root_volume_type` (string) - The type of EBS volume for the chroot environment and resulting AMI. The
  default value is the type of the source_ami, unless from_scratch is
  true, in which case the default value is gp2. You can only specify io1
  if building based on top of a source_ami which is also io1.

- `source_ami_filter` (awscommon.AmiFilterOptions) - Filters used to populate the source_ami field. Example:
  
  ```json
  {
  	 "source_ami_filter": {
  	 "filters": {
  	  "virtualization-type": "hvm",
  	  "name": "ubuntu/images/*ubuntu-xenial-16.04-amd64-server-*",
  	  "root-device-type": "ebs"
  	},
  	"owners": ["099720109477"],
  	"most_recent": true
  	 }
  }
  ```
  
  This selects the most recent Ubuntu 16.04 HVM EBS AMI from Canonical. NOTE:
  This will fail unless *exactly* one AMI is returned. In the above example,
  `most_recent` will cause this to succeed by selecting the newest image.
  
  -   `filters` (map of strings) - filters used to select a `source_ami`.
  	NOTE: This will fail unless *exactly* one AMI is returned. Any filter
  	described in the docs for
  	[DescribeImages](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeImages.html)
  	is valid.
  
  -   `owners` (array of strings) - Filters the images by their owner. You
  	may specify one or more AWS account IDs, "self" (which will use the
  	account whose credentials you are using to run Packer), or an AWS owner
  	alias: for example, "amazon", "aws-marketplace", or "microsoft". This
  	option is required for security reasons.
  
  -   `most_recent` (boolean) - Selects the newest created image when true.
  	This is most useful for selecting a daily distro build.
  
  You may set this in place of `source_ami` or in conjunction with it. If you
  set this in conjunction with `source_ami`, the `source_ami` will be added
  to the filter. The provided `source_ami` must meet all of the filtering
  criteria provided in `source_ami_filter`; this pins the AMI returned by the
  filter, but will cause Packer to fail if the `source_ami` does not exist.

- `root_volume_tags` (map[string]string) - Key/value pair tags to apply to the volumes that are *launched*. This is
  a [template engine](/docs/templates/engine), see [Build template
  data](#build-template-data) for more information.

- `root_volume_tag` ([]{key string, value string}) - Same as [`root_volume_tags`](#root_volume_tags) but defined as a
  singular block containing a `key` and a `value` field. In HCL2 mode the
  [`dynamic_block`](/docs/configuration/from-1.5/expressions#dynamic-blocks)
  will allow you to create those programatically.

- `root_volume_encrypt_boot` (boolean) - Whether or not to encrypt the volumes that are *launched*. By default, Packer will keep
  the encryption setting to what it was in the source image when set to `false`. Setting true will
  always result in an encrypted one.

- `root_volume_kms_key_id` (string) - ID, alias or ARN of the KMS key to use for *launched* volumes encryption.
  
  Set this value if you select `root_volume_encrypt_boot`, but don't want to use the
  region's default KMS key.
  
  If you have a custom kms key you'd like to apply to the launch volume,
  and are only building in one region, it is more efficient to set this
  and `root_volume_encrypt_boot` to `true` and not use `encrypt_boot` and `kms_key_id`. This saves
  potentially many minutes at the end of the build by preventing Packer
  from having to copy and re-encrypt the image at the end of the build.
  
  For valid formats see *KmsKeyId* in the [AWS API docs -
  CopyImage](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_CopyImage.html).
  This field is validated by Packer, when using an alias, you will have to
  prefix `kms_key_id` with `alias/`.

- `ami_architecture` (string) - what architecture to use when registering the final AMI; valid options
  are "x86_64" or "arm64". Defaults to "x86_64".
