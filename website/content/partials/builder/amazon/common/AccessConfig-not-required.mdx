<!-- Code generated from the comments of the AccessConfig struct in builder/amazon/common/access_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `assume_role` (AssumeRoleConfig) - If provided with a role ARN, Packer will attempt to assume this role
  using the supplied credentials. See
  [AssumeRoleConfig](#assume-role-configuration) below for more
  details on all of the options available, and for a usage example.

- `custom_endpoint_ec2` (string) - This option is useful if you use a cloud
  provider whose API is compatible with aws EC2. Specify another endpoint
  like this https://ec2.custom.endpoint.com.

- `shared_credentials_file` (string) - Path to a credentials file to load credentials from

- `decode_authorization_messages` (bool) - Enable automatic decoding of any encoded authorization (error) messages
  using the `sts:DecodeAuthorizationMessage` API. Note: requires that the
  effective user/role have permissions to `sts:DecodeAuthorizationMessage`
  on resource `*`. Default `false`.

- `insecure_skip_tls_verify` (bool) - This allows skipping TLS
  verification of the AWS EC2 endpoint. The default is false.

- `max_retries` (int) - This is the maximum number of times an API call is retried, in the case
  where requests are being throttled or experiencing transient failures.
  The delay between the subsequent API calls increases exponentially.

- `mfa_code` (string) - The MFA
  [TOTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm)
  code. This should probably be a user variable since it changes all the
  time.

- `profile` (string) - The profile to use in the shared credentials file for
  AWS. See Amazon's documentation on [specifying
  profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/configuring-sdk.html#specifying-profiles)
  for more details.

- `skip_metadata_api_check` (bool) - Skip Metadata Api Check

- `skip_credential_validation` (bool) - Set to true if you want to skip validating AWS credentials before runtime.

- `token` (string) - The access token to use. This is different from the
  access key and secret key. If you're not sure what this is, then you
  probably don't need it. This will also be read from the AWS_SESSION_TOKEN
  environmental variable.

- `vault_aws_engine` (VaultAWSEngineOptions) - Get credentials from Hashicorp Vault's aws secrets engine. You must
  already have created a role to use. For more information about
  generating credentials via the Vault engine, see the [Vault
  docs.](https://www.vaultproject.io/api/secret/aws#generate-credentials)
  If you set this flag, you must also set the below options:
  -   `name` (string) - Required. Specifies the name of the role to generate
      credentials against. This is part of the request URL.
  -   `engine_name` (string) - The name of the aws secrets engine. In the
      Vault docs, this is normally referred to as "aws", and Packer will
      default to "aws" if `engine_name` is not set.
  -   `role_arn` (string)- The ARN of the role to assume if credential\_type
      on the Vault role is assumed\_role. Must match one of the allowed role
      ARNs in the Vault role. Optional if the Vault role only allows a single
      AWS role ARN; required otherwise.
  -   `ttl` (string) - Specifies the TTL for the use of the STS token. This
      is specified as a string with a duration suffix. Valid only when
      credential\_type is assumed\_role or federation\_token. When not
      specified, the default\_sts\_ttl set for the role will be used. If that
      is also not set, then the default value of 3600s will be used. AWS
      places limits on the maximum TTL allowed. See the AWS documentation on
      the DurationSeconds parameter for AssumeRole (for assumed\_role
      credential types) and GetFederationToken (for federation\_token
      credential types) for more details.
  
  JSON example:
  
  ```json
  {
      "vault_aws_engine": {
          "name": "myrole",
          "role_arn": "myarn",
          "ttl": "3600s"
      }
  }
  ```
  
  HCL2 example:
  
  ```hcl
    vault_aws_engine {
        name = "myrole"
        role_arn = "myarn"
        ttl = "3600s"
    }
  ```

- `aws_polling` (\*AWSPollingConfig) - [Polling configuration](#polling-configuration) for the AWS waiter. Configures the waiter that checks
  resource state.
