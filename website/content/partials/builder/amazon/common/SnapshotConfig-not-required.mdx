- `snapshot_tags` (map[string]string) - Key/value pair tags to apply to snapshot. They will override AMI tags if
  already applied to snapshot. This is a [template
  engine](/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/engine), see [Build template
  data](#build-template-data) for more information.

- `snapshot_tag` ([]{key string, value string}) - Same as [`snapshot_tags`](#snapshot_tags) but defined as a singular
  repeatable block containing a `key` and a `value` field. In HCL2 mode the
  [`dynamic_block`](/docs/templates/hcl_templates/expressions#dynamic-blocks)
  will allow you to create those programatically.

- `snapshot_users` ([]string) - A list of account IDs that have
  access to create volumes from the snapshot(s). By default no additional
  users other than the user creating the AMI has permissions to create
  volumes from the backing snapshot(s).

- `snapshot_groups` ([]string) - A list of groups that have access to
  create volumes from the snapshot(s). By default no groups have permission
  to create volumes from the snapshot(s). all will make the snapshot
  publicly accessible.
