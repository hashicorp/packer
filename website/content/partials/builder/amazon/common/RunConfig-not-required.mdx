- `associate_public_ip_address` (bool) - If using a non-default VPC,
  public IP addresses are not provided by default. If this is true, your
  new instance will get a Public IP. default: false

- `availability_zone` (string) - Destination availability zone to launch
  instance in. Leave this empty to allow Amazon to auto-assign.

- `block_duration_minutes` (int64) - Requires spot_price to be set. The
  required duration for the Spot Instances (also known as Spot blocks). This
  value must be a multiple of 60 (60, 120, 180, 240, 300, or 360). You can't
  specify an Availability Zone group or a launch group if you specify a
  duration.

- `disable_stop_instance` (bool) - Packer normally stops the build instance after all provisioners have
  run. For Windows instances, it is sometimes desirable to [run
  Sysprep](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/Creating_EBSbacked_WinAMI.html)
  which will stop the instance for you. If this is set to `true`, Packer
  *will not* stop the instance but will assume that you will send the stop
  signal yourself through your final provisioner. You can do this with a
  [windows-shell provisioner](/docs/provisioners/windows-shell). Note that
  Packer will still wait for the instance to be stopped, and failing to
  send the stop signal yourself, when you have set this flag to `true`,
  will cause a timeout.
  
  An example of a valid windows shutdown command in a `windows-shell`
  provisioner is :
  ```shell-session
    ec2config.exe -sysprep
  ```
  or
  ```sell-session
    "%programfiles%\amazon\ec2configservice\"ec2config.exe -sysprep""
  ```
  -> Note: The double quotation marks in the command are not required if
  your CMD shell is already in the
  `C:\Program Files\Amazon\EC2ConfigService\` directory.

- `ebs_optimized` (bool) - Mark instance as [EBS
  Optimized](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSOptimized.html).
  Default `false`.

- `enable_t2_unlimited` (bool) - Enabling T2 Unlimited allows the source instance to burst additional CPU
  beyond its available [CPU
  Credits](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/t2-credits-baseline-concepts.html)
  for as long as the demand exists. This is in contrast to the standard
  configuration that only allows an instance to consume up to its
  available CPU Credits. See the AWS documentation for [T2
  Unlimited](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/t2-unlimited.html)
  and the **T2 Unlimited Pricing** section of the [Amazon EC2 On-Demand
  Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/) document for
  more information. By default this option is disabled and Packer will set
  up a [T2
  Standard](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/t2-std.html)
  instance instead.
  
  To use T2 Unlimited you must use a T2 instance type, e.g. `t2.micro`.
  Additionally, T2 Unlimited cannot be used in conjunction with Spot
  Instances, e.g. when the `spot_price` option has been configured.
  Attempting to do so will cause an error.
  
  !&gt; **Warning!** Additional costs may be incurred by enabling T2
  Unlimited - even for instances that would usually qualify for the
  [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/).

- `iam_instance_profile` (string) - The name of an [IAM instance
  profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/instance-profiles.html)
  to launch the EC2 instance with.

- `skip_profile_validation` (bool) - Whether or not to check if the IAM instance profile exists. Defaults to false

- `temporary_iam_instance_profile_policy_document` (\*PolicyDocument) - Temporary IAM instance profile policy document
  If IamInstanceProfile is specified it will be used instead.
  
  HCL2 example:
  ```hcl
  temporary_iam_instance_profile_policy_document {
  	Statement {
  		Action   = ["logs:*"]
  		Effect   = "Allow"
  		Resource = "*"
  	}
  	Version = "2012-10-17"
  }
  ```
  
  JSON example:
  ```json
  {
  	"Version": "2012-10-17",
  	"Statement": [
  		{
  			"Action": [
  			"logs:*"
  			],
  			"Effect": "Allow",
  			"Resource": "*"
  		}
  	]
  }
  ```

- `shutdown_behavior` (string) - Automatically terminate instances on
  shutdown in case Packer exits ungracefully. Possible values are stop and
  terminate. Defaults to stop.

- `security_group_filter` (SecurityGroupFilterOptions) - Filters used to populate the `security_group_ids` field.
  
  HCL2 Example:
  
  ```hcl
    security_group_filter {
      filters = {
        "tag:Class": "packer"
      }
    }
  ```
  
  JSON Example:
  ```json
  {
    "security_group_filter": {
      "filters": {
        "tag:Class": "packer"
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  
  This selects the SG's with tag `Class` with the value `packer`.
  
  -   `filters` (map of strings) - filters used to select a
      `security_group_ids`. Any filter described in the docs for
      [DescribeSecurityGroups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeSecurityGroups.html)
      is valid.
  
  `security_group_ids` take precedence over this.

- `run_tags` (map[string]string) - Key/value pair tags to apply to the instance that is that is *launched*
  to create the EBS volumes. This is a [template
  engine](/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/engine), see [Build template
  data](#build-template-data) for more information.

- `run_tag` ([]{key string, value string}) - Same as [`run_tags`](#run_tags) but defined as a singular repeatable
  block containing a `key` and a `value` field. In HCL2 mode the
  [`dynamic_block`](/docs/templates/hcl_templates/expressions#dynamic-blocks)
  will allow you to create those programatically.

- `security_group_id` (string) - The ID (not the name) of the security
  group to assign to the instance. By default this is not set and Packer will
  automatically create a new temporary security group to allow SSH access.
  Note that if this is specified, you must be sure the security group allows
  access to the ssh_port given below.

- `security_group_ids` ([]string) - A list of security groups as
  described above. Note that if this is specified, you must omit the
  security_group_id.

- `source_ami_filter` (AmiFilterOptions) - Filters used to populate the `source_ami`
  field.
  
  HCL2 example:
  ```hcl
  source "amazon-ebs" "basic-example" {
    source_ami_filter {
      filters = {
         virtualization-type = "hvm"
         name = "ubuntu/images/\*ubuntu-xenial-16.04-amd64-server-\*"
         root-device-type = "ebs"
      }
      owners = ["099720109477"]
      most_recent = true
    }
  }
  ```
  
  JSON Example:
  ```json
  "builders" [
    {
      "type": "amazon-ebs",
      "source_ami_filter": {
         "filters": {
         "virtualization-type": "hvm",
         "name": "ubuntu/images/\*ubuntu-xenial-16.04-amd64-server-\*",
         "root-device-type": "ebs"
         },
         "owners": ["099720109477"],
         "most_recent": true
      }
    }
  ]
  ```
  
    This selects the most recent Ubuntu 16.04 HVM EBS AMI from Canonical. NOTE:
    This will fail unless *exactly* one AMI is returned. In the above example,
    `most_recent` will cause this to succeed by selecting the newest image.
  
    -   `filters` (map of strings) - filters used to select a `source_ami`.
        NOTE: This will fail unless *exactly* one AMI is returned. Any filter
        described in the docs for
        [DescribeImages](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeImages.html)
        is valid.
  
    -   `owners` (array of strings) - Filters the images by their owner. You
        may specify one or more AWS account IDs, "self" (which will use the
        account whose credentials you are using to run Packer), or an AWS owner
        alias: for example, `amazon`, `aws-marketplace`, or `microsoft`. This
        option is required for security reasons.
  
    -   `most_recent` (boolean) - Selects the newest created image when true.
        This is most useful for selecting a daily distro build.
  
    You may set this in place of `source_ami` or in conjunction with it. If you
    set this in conjunction with `source_ami`, the `source_ami` will be added
    to the filter. The provided `source_ami` must meet all of the filtering
    criteria provided in `source_ami_filter`; this pins the AMI returned by the
    filter, but will cause Packer to fail if the `source_ami` does not exist.

- `spot_instance_types` ([]string) - a list of acceptable instance
  types to run your build on. We will request a spot instance using the max
  price of spot_price and the allocation strategy of "lowest price".
  Your instance will be launched on an instance type of the lowest available
  price that you have in your list.  This is used in place of instance_type.
  You may only set either spot_instance_types or instance_type, not both.
  This feature exists to help prevent situations where a Packer build fails
  because a particular availability zone does not have capacity for the
  specific instance_type requested in instance_type.

- `spot_price` (string) - With Spot Instances, you pay the Spot price that's in effect for the
  time period your instances are running. Spot Instance prices are set by
  Amazon EC2 and adjust gradually based on long-term trends in supply and
  demand for Spot Instance capacity.
  
  When this field is set, it represents the maximum hourly price you are
  willing to pay for a spot instance. If you do not set this value, it
  defaults to a maximum price equal to the on demand price of the
  instance. In the situation where the current Amazon-set spot price
  exceeds the value set in this field, Packer will not launch an instance
  and the build will error. In the situation where the Amazon-set spot
  price is less than the value set in this field, Packer will launch and
  you will pay the Amazon-set spot price, not this maximum value.
  For more information, see the Amazon docs on
  [spot pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/pricing/).

- `spot_tags` (map[string]string) - Requires spot_price to be set. Key/value pair tags to apply tags to the
  spot request that is issued.

- `spot_tag` ([]{key string, value string}) - Same as [`spot_tags`](#spot_tags) but defined as a singular repeatable block
  containing a `key` and a `value` field. In HCL2 mode the
  [`dynamic_block`](/docs/templates/hcl_templates/expressions#dynamic-blocks)
  will allow you to create those programatically.

- `subnet_filter` (SubnetFilterOptions) - Filters used to populate the `subnet_id` field.
  
  HCL2 example:
  
  ```hcl
  source "amazon-ebs" "basic-example" {
    subnet_filter {
      filters = {
            "tag:Class": "build"
      }
      most_free = true
      random = false
    }
  }
  ```
  
  JSON Example:
  ```json
  "builders" [
    {
      "type": "amazon-ebs",
      "subnet_filter": {
        "filters": {
          "tag:Class": "build"
        },
        "most_free": true,
        "random": false
      }
    }
  ]
  ```
  
    This selects the Subnet with tag `Class` with the value `build`, which has
    the most free IP addresses. NOTE: This will fail unless *exactly* one
    Subnet is returned. By using `most_free` or `random` one will be selected
    from those matching the filter.
  
    -   `filters` (map of strings) - filters used to select a `subnet_id`.
        NOTE: This will fail unless *exactly* one Subnet is returned. Any
        filter described in the docs for
        [DescribeSubnets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeSubnets.html)
        is valid.
  
    -   `most_free` (boolean) - The Subnet with the most free IPv4 addresses
        will be used if multiple Subnets matches the filter.
  
    -   `random` (boolean) - A random Subnet will be used if multiple Subnets
        matches the filter. `most_free` have precendence over this.
  
    `subnet_id` take precedence over this.

- `subnet_id` (string) - If using VPC, the ID of the subnet, such as
  subnet-12345def, where Packer will launch the EC2 instance. This field is
  required if you are using an non-default VPC.

- `tenancy` (string) - [Tenancy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/dedicated-instance.html) used
  when Packer launches the EC2 instance, allowing it to be launched on dedicated hardware.
  
  The default is "default", meaning shared tenancy. Allowed values are "default",
  "dedicated" and "host".

- `temporary_security_group_source_cidrs` ([]string) - A list of IPv4 CIDR blocks to be authorized access to the instance, when
  packer is creating a temporary security group.
  
  The default is [`0.0.0.0/0`] (i.e., allow any IPv4 source). This is only
  used when `security_group_id` or `security_group_ids` is not specified.

- `user_data` (string) - User data to apply when launching the instance. Note
  that you need to be careful about escaping characters due to the templates
  being JSON. It is often more convenient to use user_data_file, instead.
  Packer will not automatically wait for a user script to finish before
  shutting down the instance this must be handled in a provisioner.

- `user_data_file` (string) - Path to a file that will be used for the user
  data when launching the instance.

- `vpc_filter` (VpcFilterOptions) - Filters used to populate the `vpc_id` field.
  
  HCL2 example:
  ```hcl
  source "amazon-ebs" "basic-example" {
    vpc_filter {
      filters = {
        "tag:Class": "build",
        "isDefault": "false",
        "cidr": "/24"
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  
  JSON Example:
  ```json
  "builders" [
    {
      "type": "amazon-ebs",
      "vpc_filter": {
        "filters": {
          "tag:Class": "build",
          "isDefault": "false",
          "cidr": "/24"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
  ```
  
  This selects the VPC with tag `Class` with the value `build`, which is not
  the default VPC, and have a IPv4 CIDR block of `/24`. NOTE: This will fail
  unless *exactly* one VPC is returned.
  
  -   `filters` (map of strings) - filters used to select a `vpc_id`. NOTE:
      This will fail unless *exactly* one VPC is returned. Any filter
      described in the docs for
      [DescribeVpcs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeVpcs.html)
      is valid.
  
  `vpc_id` take precedence over this.

- `vpc_id` (string) - If launching into a VPC subnet, Packer needs the VPC ID
  in order to create a temporary security group within the VPC. Requires
  subnet_id to be set. If this field is left blank, Packer will try to get
  the VPC ID from the subnet_id.

- `windows_password_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - The timeout for waiting for a Windows
  password for Windows instances. Defaults to 20 minutes. Example value:
  10m

- `metadata_options` (MetadataOptions) - [Metadata Settings](#metadata-settings)

- `ssh_interface` (string) - One of `public_ip`, `private_ip`, `public_dns`, `private_dns` or `session_manager`.
     If set, either the public IP address, private IP address, public DNS name
     or private DNS name will be used as the host for SSH. The default behaviour
     if inside a VPC is to use the public IP address if available, otherwise
     the private IP address will be used. If not in a VPC the public DNS name
     will be used. Also works for WinRM.
  
     Where Packer is configured for an outbound proxy but WinRM traffic
     should be direct, `ssh_interface` must be set to `private_dns` and
     `<region>.compute.internal` included in the `NO_PROXY` environment
     variable.
  
     When using `session_manager` the machine running Packer must have
  	  the AWS Session Manager Plugin installed and within the users' system path.
     Connectivity via the `session_manager` interface establishes a secure tunnel
     between the local host and the remote host on an available local port to the specified `ssh_port`.
     See [Session Manager Connections](#session-manager-connections) for more information.
     - Session manager connectivity is currently only implemented for the SSH communicator, not the WinRM communicator.
     - Upon termination the secure tunnel will be terminated automatically, if however there is a failure in
     terminating the tunnel it will automatically terminate itself after 20 minutes of inactivity.

- `pause_before_ssm` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - The time to wait before establishing the Session Manager session.
  The value of this should be a duration. Examples are
  `5s` and `1m30s` which will cause Packer to wait five seconds and one
  minute 30 seconds, respectively. If no set, defaults to 10 seconds.
  This option is useful when the remote port takes longer to become available.

- `session_manager_port` (int) - Which port to connect the local end of the session tunnel to. If
  left blank, Packer will choose a port for you from available ports.
  This option is only used when `ssh_interface` is set `session_manager`.
