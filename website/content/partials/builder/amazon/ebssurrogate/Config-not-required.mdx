- `ami_block_device_mappings` (awscommon.BlockDevices) - Add one or more block device mappings to the AMI. These will be attached
  when booting a new instance from your AMI. To add a block device during
  the Packer build see `launch_block_device_mappings` below. Your options
  here may vary depending on the type of VM you use. See the
  [BlockDevices](#block-devices-configuration) documentation for fields.

- `launch_block_device_mappings` (BlockDevices) - Add one or more block devices before the Packer build starts. If you add
  instance store volumes or EBS volumes in addition to the root device
  volume, the created AMI will contain block device mapping information
  for those volumes. Amazon creates snapshots of the source instance's
  root volume and any other EBS volumes described here. When you launch an
  instance from this new AMI, the instance automatically launches with
  these additional volumes, and will restore them from snapshots taken
  from the source instance. See the
  [BlockDevices](#block-devices-configuration) documentation for fields.

- `run_volume_tags` (map[string]string) - Tags to apply to the volumes that are *launched* to create the AMI.
  These tags are *not* applied to the resulting AMI unless they're
  duplicated in `tags`. This is a [template
  engine](/docs/templates/engine), see [Build template
  data](#build-template-data) for more information.

- `run_volume_tag` ([]{name string, value string}) - Same as [`run_volume_tags`](#run_volume_tags) but defined as a singular
  block containing a `name` and a `value` field. In HCL2 mode the
  [`dynamic_block`](https://packer.io/docs/configuration/from-1.5/expressions.html#dynamic-blocks)
  will allow you to create those programatically.

- `ami_architecture` (string) - what architecture to use when registering the
  final AMI; valid options are "x86_64" or "arm64". Defaults to "x86_64".
