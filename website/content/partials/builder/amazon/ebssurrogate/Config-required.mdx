- `ami_root_device` (RootBlockDevice) - A block device mapping describing the root device of the AMI. This looks
  like the mappings in `ami_block_device_mapping`, except with an
  additional field:
  
  -   `source_device_name` (string) - The device name of the block device on
      the source instance to be used as the root device for the AMI. This
      must correspond to a block device in `launch_block_device_mapping`.
