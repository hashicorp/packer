<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in builder/amazon/ebsvolume/builder.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `ena_support` (boolean) - Enable enhanced networking (ENA but not SriovNetSupport) on
  HVM-compatible AMIs. If set, add `ec2:ModifyInstanceAttribute` to your
  AWS IAM policy. Note: you must make sure enhanced networking is enabled
  on your instance. See [Amazon's documentation on enabling enhanced
  networking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/enhanced-networking.html#enabling_enhanced_networking).

- `sriov_support` (bool) - Enable enhanced networking (SriovNetSupport but not ENA) on
  HVM-compatible AMIs. If true, add `ec2:ModifyInstanceAttribute` to your
  AWS IAM policy. Note: you must make sure enhanced networking is enabled
  on your instance. See [Amazon's documentation on enabling enhanced
  networking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/enhanced-networking.html#enabling_enhanced_networking).
  Default `false`.

- `ebs_volumes` (BlockDevices) - Add the block device mappings to the AMI. If you add instance store
  volumes or EBS volumes in addition to the root device volume, the
  created AMI will contain block device mapping information for those
  volumes. Amazon creates snapshots of the source instance's root volume
  and any other EBS volumes described here. When you launch an instance
  from this new AMI, the instance automatically launches with these
  additional volumes, and will restore them from snapshots taken from the
  source instance. See the [BlockDevices](#block-devices-configuration)
  documentation for fields.

- `run_volume_tags` (map[string]string) - Key/value pair tags to apply to the volumes of the instance that is
  *launched* to create EBS Volumes. These tags will *not* appear in the
  tags of the resulting EBS volumes unless they're duplicated under `tags`
  in the `ebs_volumes` setting. This is a [template
  engine](/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/engine), see [Build template
  data](#build-template-data) for more information.
  
   Note: The tags specified here will be *temporarily* applied to volumes
  specified in `ebs_volumes` - but only while the instance is being
  created. Packer will replace all tags on the volume with the tags
  configured in the `ebs_volumes` section as soon as the instance is
  reported as 'ready'.

- `run_volume_tag` ([]{key string, value string}) - Same as [`run_volume_tags`](#run_volume_tags) but defined as a singular
  repeatable block containing a `key` and a `value` field. In HCL2 mode
  the
  [`dynamic_block`](/docs/templates/hcl_templates/expressions#dynamic-blocks)
  will allow you to create those programatically.
