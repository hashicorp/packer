<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in builder/digitalocean/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `api_url` (string) - Non standard api endpoint URL. Set this if you are
  using a DigitalOcean API compatible service. It can also be specified via
  environment variable DIGITALOCEAN_API_URL.

- `private_networking` (bool) - Set to true to enable private networking
  for the droplet being created. This defaults to false, or not enabled.

- `monitoring` (bool) - Set to true to enable monitoring for the droplet
  being created. This defaults to false, or not enabled.

- `ipv6` (bool) - Set to true to enable ipv6 for the droplet being
  created. This defaults to false, or not enabled.

- `snapshot_name` (string) - The name of the resulting snapshot that will
  appear in your account. Defaults to `packer-{{timestamp}}` (see
  configuration templates for more info).

- `snapshot_regions` ([]string) - The regions of the resulting
  snapshot that will appear in your account.

- `state_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - The time to wait, as a duration string, for a
  droplet to enter a desired state (such as "active") before timing out. The
  default state timeout is "6m".

- `snapshot_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - How long to wait for an image to be published to the shared image
  gallery before timing out. If your Packer build is failing on the
  Publishing to Shared Image Gallery step with the error `Original Error:
  context deadline exceeded`, but the image is present when you check your
  Azure dashboard, then you probably need to increase this timeout from
  its default of "60m" (valid time units include `s` for seconds, `m` for
  minutes, and `h` for hours.)

- `droplet_name` (string) - The name assigned to the droplet. DigitalOcean
  sets the hostname of the machine to this value.

- `user_data` (string) - User data to launch with the Droplet. Packer will
  not automatically wait for a user script to finish before shutting down the
  instance this must be handled in a provisioner.

- `user_data_file` (string) - Path to a file that will be used for the user
  data when launching the Droplet.

- `tags` ([]string) - Tags to apply to the droplet when it is created

- `vpc_uuid` (string) - UUID of the VPC which the droplet will be created in. Before using this,
  private_networking should be enabled.

- `connect_with_private_ip` (bool) - Wheter the communicators should use private IP or not (public IP in that case).
  If the droplet is or going to be accessible only from the local network because
  it is at behind a firewall, then communicators should use the private IP
  instead of the public IP. Before using this, private_networking should be enabled.
