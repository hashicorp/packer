<!-- Code generated from the comments of the Config struct in builder/virtualbox/iso/builder.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `disk_size` (uint) - The size, in megabytes, of the hard disk to create for the VM. By
  default, this is 40000 (about 40 GB).

- `guest_os_type` (string) - The guest OS type being installed. By default this is other, but you can
  get dramatic performance improvements by setting this to the proper
  value. To view all available values for this run VBoxManage list
  ostypes. Setting the correct value hints to VirtualBox how to optimize
  the virtual hardware to work best with that operating system.

- `hard_drive_discard` (bool) - When this value is set to true, a VDI image will be shrunk in response
  to the trim command from the guest OS. The size of the cleared area must
  be at least 1MB. Also set hard_drive_nonrotational to true to enable
  TRIM support.

- `hard_drive_interface` (string) - The type of controller that the primary hard drive is attached to,
  defaults to ide. When set to sata, the drive is attached to an AHCI SATA
  controller. When set to scsi, the drive is attached to an LsiLogic SCSI
  controller. When set to pcie, the drive is attached to an NVMe
  controller. Please note that when you use "pcie", you'll need to have
  Virtualbox 6, install an [extension
  pack](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads#VirtualBox6.0.14OracleVMVirtualBoxExtensionPack)
  and you will need to enable EFI mode for nvme to work, ex:
  
  In JSON:
  ```json
   "vboxmanage": [
        [ "modifyvm", "{{.Name}}", "--firmware", "EFI" ],
   ]
  ```
  
  In HCL2:
  ```hcl
   vboxmanage = [
        [ "modifyvm", "{{.Name}}", "--firmware", "EFI" ],
   ]
  ```

- `sata_port_count` (int) - The number of ports available on any SATA controller created, defaults
  to 1. VirtualBox supports up to 30 ports on a maximum of 1 SATA
  controller. Increasing this value can be useful if you want to attach
  additional drives.

- `nvme_port_count` (int) - The number of ports available on any NVMe controller created, defaults
  to 1. VirtualBox supports up to 255 ports on a maximum of 1 NVMe
  controller. Increasing this value can be useful if you want to attach
  additional drives.

- `hard_drive_nonrotational` (bool) - Forces some guests (i.e. Windows 7+) to treat disks as SSDs and stops
  them from performing disk fragmentation. Also set hard_drive_discard to
  true to enable TRIM support.

- `iso_interface` (string) - The type of controller that the ISO is attached to, defaults to ide.
  When set to sata, the drive is attached to an AHCI SATA controller.

- `keep_registered` (bool) - Set this to true if you would like to keep the VM registered with
  virtualbox. Defaults to false.

- `skip_export` (bool) - Defaults to false. When enabled, Packer will not export the VM. Useful
  if the build output is not the resultant image, but created inside the
  VM.

- `vm_name` (string) - This is the name of the OVF file for the new virtual machine, without
  the file extension. By default this is packer-BUILDNAME, where
  "BUILDNAME" is the name of the build.
