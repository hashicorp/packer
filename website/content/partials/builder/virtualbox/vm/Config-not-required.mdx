- `attach_snapshot` (string) - Default to `null/empty`. The name of an
   **existing** snapshot to which the builder shall attach the VM before
   starting it. If no snapshot is specified the builder will simply start the
   VM from it's current state i.e. snapshot.

- `target_snapshot` (string) - Default to `null/empty`. The name of the
    snapshot which shall be created after all provisioners has been run by the
    builder. If no target snapshot is specified and `keep_registered` is set to
    `false` the builder will revert to the snapshot to which the VM was attached
    before the builder has been executed, which will revert all changes applied
    by the provisioners. This is handy if only an export shall be created and no
    further snapshot is required.

- `force_delete_snapshot` (bool) - Defaults to `false`. If set to `true`,
    overwrite an existing `target_snapshot`. Otherwise the builder will yield an
    error if the specified target snapshot already exists.

- `keep_registered` (bool) - Set this to `true` if you would like to keep
    the VM attached to the snapshot specified by `attach_snapshot`. Otherwise
    the builder will reset the VM to the snapshot to which the VM was attached
    before the builder started. Defaults to `false`.

- `skip_export` (bool) - Defaults to `false`. When enabled, Packer will
    not export the VM. Useful if the builder should be applied again on the created
    target snapshot.
