- `import_flags` ([]string) - Additional flags to pass to
  VBoxManage import. This can be used to add additional command-line flags
  such as --eula-accept to accept a EULA in the OVF.

- `import_opts` (string) - Additional options to pass to the
  VBoxManage import. This can be useful for passing keepallmacs or
  keepnatmacs options for existing ovf images.

- `target_path` (string) - The path where the OVA should be saved
  after download. By default, it will go in the packer cache, with a hash of
  the original filename as its name.

- `vm_name` (string) - This is the name of the OVF file for the new virtual
  machine, without the file extension. By default this is packer-BUILDNAME,
  where "BUILDNAME" is the name of the build.

- `keep_registered` (bool) - Set this to true if you would like to keep
  the VM registered with virtualbox. Defaults to false.

- `skip_export` (bool) - Defaults to false. When enabled, Packer will
  not export the VM. Useful if the build output is not the resultant image,
  but created inside the VM.
