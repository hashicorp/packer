- `shutdown_command` (string) - The command to use to gracefully shut down the
  machine once all the provisioning is done. By default this is an empty
  string, which tells Packer to just forcefully shut down the machine unless a
  shutdown command takes place inside script so this may safely be omitted. If
  one or more scripts require a reboot it is suggested to leave this blank
  since reboots may fail and specify the final shutdown command in your
  last script.

- `shutdown_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - The amount of time to wait after executing the
  shutdown_command for the virtual machine to actually shut down. If it
  doesn't shut down in this time, it is an error. By default, the timeout is
  5m or five minutes.

- `post_shutdown_delay` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - The amount of time to wait after shutting
  down the virtual machine. If you get the error
  Error removing floppy controller, you might need to set this to 5m
  or so. By default, the delay is 0s or disabled.

- `disable_shutdown` (bool) - Packer normally halts the virtual machine after all provisioners have
  run when no `shutdown_command` is defined. If this is set to `true`, Packer
  _will not_ halt the virtual machine but will assume that you will send the stop
  signal yourself through the preseed.cfg or your final provisioner.
  Packer will wait for a default of 5 minutes until the virtual machine is shutdown.
  The timeout can be changed using `shutdown_timeout` option.

- `acpi_shutdown` (bool) - If it's set to true, it will shutdown the VM via power button. It could be a good option
  when keeping the machine state is necessary after shutting it down.
