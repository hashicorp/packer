<!-- Code generated from the comments of the GuestAdditionsConfig struct in builder/virtualbox/common/guest_additions_config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `guest_additions_mode` (string) - The method by which guest additions are
  made available to the guest for installation. Valid options are `upload`,
  `attach`, or `disable`. If the mode is `attach` the guest additions ISO will
  be attached as a CD device to the virtual machine. If the mode is `upload`
  the guest additions ISO will be uploaded to the path specified by
  `guest_additions_path`. The default value is `upload`. If `disable` is used,
  guest additions won't be downloaded, either.

- `guest_additions_interface` (string) - The interface type to use to mount guest additions when
  guest_additions_mode is set to attach. Will default to the value set in
  iso_interface, if iso_interface is set. Will default to "ide", if
  iso_interface is not set. Options are "ide" and "sata".

- `guest_additions_path` (string) - The path on the guest virtual machine
   where the VirtualBox guest additions ISO will be uploaded. By default this
   is `VBoxGuestAdditions.iso` which should upload into the login directory of
   the user. This is a [configuration
   template](/docs/templates/engine) where the `Version`
   variable is replaced with the VirtualBox version.

- `guest_additions_sha256` (string) - The SHA256 checksum of the guest
   additions ISO that will be uploaded to the guest VM. By default the
   checksums will be downloaded from the VirtualBox website, so this only needs
   to be set if you want to be explicit about the checksum.

- `guest_additions_url` (string) - The URL of the guest additions ISO
   to upload. This can also be a file URL if the ISO is at a local path. By
   default, the VirtualBox builder will attempt to find the guest additions ISO
   on the local file system. If it is not available locally, the builder will
   download the proper guest additions ISO from the internet.
