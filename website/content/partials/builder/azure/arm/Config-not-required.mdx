- `user_assigned_managed_identities` ([]string) - A list of one or more fully-qualified resource IDs of user assigned
  managed identities to be configured on the VM.
  See [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-use-vm-token)
  for how to acquire tokens within the VM.
  To assign a user assigned managed identity to a VM, the provided account or service principal must have [Managed Identity Operator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#managed-identity-operator)
  and [Virtual Machine Contributor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#virtual-machine-contributor) role assignments.

- `capture_name_prefix` (string) - VHD prefix.

- `capture_container_name` (string) - Destination container name.

- `shared_image_gallery` (SharedImageGallery) - Use a [Shared Gallery
  image](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/announcing-the-public-preview-of-shared-image-gallery/)
  as the source for this build. *VHD targets are incompatible with this
  build type* - the target must be a *Managed Image*. When using shared_image_gallery as a source, image_publisher,
  image_offer, image_sku, image_version, and custom_managed_image_name should not be set.
  
  In JSON
  ```json

  ```
  In HCL2
  ```hcl
  shared_image_gallery {
      subscription = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000000"
      resource_group = "ResourceGroup"
      gallery_name = "GalleryName"
      image_name = "ImageName"
      image_version = "1.0.0"
  }
  managed_image_name = "TargetImageName"
  managed_image_resource_group_name = "TargetResourceGroup"
  ```

- `shared_image_gallery_destination` (SharedImageGalleryDestination) - The name of the Shared Image Gallery under which the managed image will be published as Shared Gallery Image version.
  
  Following is an example.
  
  In JSON
  ```json
  "shared_image_gallery_destination": {
      "subscription": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000000",
      "resource_group": "ResourceGroup",
      "gallery_name": "GalleryName",
      "image_name": "ImageName",

  ```

- `shared_image_gallery_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - How long to wait for an image to be published to the shared image
  gallery before timing out. If your Packer build is failing on the
  Publishing to Shared Image Gallery step with the error `Original Error:
  context deadline exceeded`, but the image is present when you check your
  Azure dashboard, then you probably need to increase this timeout from
  its default of "60m" (valid time units include `s` for seconds, `m` for
  minutes, and `h` for hours.)

- `shared_gallery_image_version_end_of_life_date` (string) - The end of life date (2006-01-02T15:04:05.99Z) of the gallery Image Version. This property
  can be used for decommissioning purposes.

- `shared_image_gallery_replica_count` (int32) - The number of replicas of the Image Version to be created per region. This
  property would take effect for a region when regionalReplicaCount is not specified.
  Replica count must be between 1 and 10.

- `shared_gallery_image_version_exclude_from_latest` (bool) - If set to true, Virtual Machines deployed from the latest version of the
  Image Definition won't use this Image Version.

- `image_version` (string) - Specify a specific version of an OS to boot from.
  Defaults to `latest`. There may be a difference in versions available
  across regions due to image synchronization latency. To ensure a consistent
  version across regions set this value to one that is available in all
  regions where you are deploying.
  
  CLI example
  `az vm image list --location westus --publisher Canonical --offer UbuntuServer --sku 16.04.0-LTS --all`

- `location` (string) - Azure datacenter in which your VM will build.

- `vm_size` (string) - Size of the VM used for building. This can be changed when you deploy a
  VM from your VHD. See
  [pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/virtual-machines/)
  information. Defaults to `Standard_A1`.
  
  CLI example `az vm list-sizes --location westus`

- `managed_image_resource_group_name` (string) - Specify the managed image resource group name where the result of the
  Packer build will be saved. The resource group must already exist. If
  this value is set, the value managed_image_name must also be set. See
  documentation to learn more about managed images.

- `managed_image_name` (string) - Specify the managed image name where the result of the Packer build will
  be saved. The image name must not exist ahead of time, and will not be
  overwritten. If this value is set, the value
  managed_image_resource_group_name must also be set. See documentation to
  learn more about managed images.

- `managed_image_storage_account_type` (string) - Specify the storage account
  type for a managed image. Valid values are Standard_LRS and Premium_LRS.
  The default is Standard_LRS.

- `managed_image_os_disk_snapshot_name` (string) - If
  managed_image_os_disk_snapshot_name is set, a snapshot of the OS disk
  is created with the same name as this value before the VM is captured.

- `managed_image_data_disk_snapshot_prefix` (string) - If
  managed_image_data_disk_snapshot_prefix is set, snapshot of the data
  disk(s) is created with the same prefix as this value before the VM is
  captured.

- `managed_image_zone_resilient` (bool) - Store the image in zone-resilient storage. You need to create it in a
  region that supports [availability
  zones](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/availability-zones/az-overview).

- `azure_tags` (map[string]string) - Name/value pair tags to apply to every resource deployed i.e. Resource
  Group, VM, NIC, VNET, Public IP, KeyVault, etc. The user can define up
  to 15 tags. Tag names cannot exceed 512 characters, and tag values
  cannot exceed 256 characters.

- `azure_tag` ([]{name string, value string}) - Same as [`azure_tags`](#azure_tags) but defined as a singular repeatable block
  containing a `name` and a `value` field. In HCL2 mode the
  [`dynamic_block`](/docs/configuration/from-1.5/expressions#dynamic-blocks)
  will allow you to create those programatically.

- `resource_group_name` (string) - Resource group under which the final artifact will be stored.

- `storage_account` (string) - Storage account under which the final artifact will be stored.

- `temp_compute_name` (string) - temporary name assigned to the VM. If this
  value is not set, a random value will be assigned. Knowing the resource
  group and VM name allows one to execute commands to update the VM during a
  Packer build, e.g. attach a resource disk to the VM.

- `temp_resource_group_name` (string) - name assigned to the temporary resource group created during the build.
  If this value is not set, a random value will be assigned. This resource
  group is deleted at the end of the build.

- `build_resource_group_name` (string) - Specify an existing resource group to run the build in.

- `build_key_vault_name` (string) - Specify an existing key vault to use for uploading certificates to the
  instance to connect.

- `build_key_vault_sku` (string) - Specify the KeyVault SKU to create during the build. Valid values are
  standard or premium. The default value is standard.

- `private_virtual_network_with_public_ip` (bool) - This value allows you to
  set a virtual_network_name and obtain a public IP. If this value is not
  set and virtual_network_name is defined Packer is only allowed to be
  executed from a host on the same subnet / virtual network.

- `virtual_network_name` (string) - Use a pre-existing virtual network for the
  VM. This option enables private communication with the VM, no public IP
  address is used or provisioned (unless you set
  private_virtual_network_with_public_ip).

- `virtual_network_subnet_name` (string) - If virtual_network_name is set,
  this value may also be set. If virtual_network_name is set, and this
  value is not set the builder attempts to determine the subnet to use with
  the virtual network. If the subnet cannot be found, or it cannot be
  disambiguated, this value should be set.

- `virtual_network_resource_group_name` (string) - If virtual_network_name is
  set, this value may also be set. If virtual_network_name is set, and
  this value is not set the builder attempts to determine the resource group
  containing the virtual network. If the resource group cannot be found, or
  it cannot be disambiguated, this value should be set.

- `custom_data_file` (string) - Specify a file containing custom data to inject into the cloud-init
  process. The contents of the file are read and injected into the ARM
  template. The custom data will be passed to cloud-init for processing at
  the time of provisioning. See
  [documentation](http://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/examples.html)
  to learn more about custom data, and how it can be used to influence the
  provisioning process.

- `plan_info` (PlanInformation) - Used for creating images from Marketplace images. Please refer to
  [Deploy an image with Marketplace
  terms](https://aka.ms/azuremarketplaceapideployment) for more details.
  Not all Marketplace images support programmatic deployment, and support
  is controlled by the image publisher.
  
  An example plan\_info object is defined below.
  
  ```json
  {
    "plan_info": {
        "plan_name": "rabbitmq",
        "plan_product": "rabbitmq",
        "plan_publisher": "bitnami"
    }
  }
  ```
  
  `plan_name` (string) - The plan name, required. `plan_product` (string) -
  The plan product, required. `plan_publisher` (string) - The plan publisher,
  required. `plan_promotion_code` (string) - Some images accept a promotion
  code, optional.
  
  Images created from the Marketplace with `plan_info` **must** specify
  `plan_info` whenever the image is deployed. The builder automatically adds
  tags to the image to ensure this information is not lost. The following
  tags are added.
  
  ```text
  1.  PlanName
  2.  PlanProduct
  3.  PlanPublisher
  4.  PlanPromotionCode
  ```

- `polling_duration_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - The default PollingDuration for azure is 15mins, this property will override
  that value. See [Azure DefaultPollingDuration](https://godoc.org/github.com/Azure/go-autorest/autorest#pkg-constants)
  If your Packer build is failing on the
  ARM deployment step with the error `Original Error:
  context deadline exceeded`, then you probably need to increase this timeout from
  its default of "15m" (valid time units include `s` for seconds, `m` for
  minutes, and `h` for hours.)

- `os_type` (string) - If either Linux or Windows is specified Packer will
  automatically configure authentication credentials for the provisioned
  machine. For Linux this configures an SSH authorized key. For Windows
  this configures a WinRM certificate.

- `os_disk_size_gb` (int32) - Specify the size of the OS disk in GB
  (gigabytes). Values of zero or less than zero are ignored.

- `disk_additional_size` ([]int32) - The size(s) of any additional hard disks for the VM in gigabytes. If
  this is not specified then the VM will only contain an OS disk. The
  number of additional disks and maximum size of a disk depends on the
  configuration of your VM. See
  [Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/about-disks-and-vhds)
  or
  [Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/about-disks-and-vhds)
  for more information.
  
  For VHD builds the final artifacts will be named
  `PREFIX-dataDisk-<n>.UUID.vhd` and stored in the specified capture
  container along side the OS disk. The additional disks are included in
  the deployment template `PREFIX-vmTemplate.UUID`.
  
  For Managed build the final artifacts are included in the managed image.
  The additional disk will have the same storage account type as the OS
  disk, as specified with the `managed_image_storage_account_type`
  setting.

- `disk_caching_type` (string) - Specify the disk caching type. Valid values
  are None, ReadOnly, and ReadWrite. The default value is ReadWrite.

- `allowed_inbound_ip_addresses` ([]string) - Specify the list of IP addresses and CIDR blocks that should be
  allowed access to the VM. If provided, an Azure Network Security
  Group will be created with corresponding rules and be bound to
  the subnet of the VM.
  Providing `allowed_inbound_ip_addresses` in combination with
  `virtual_network_name` is not allowed.

- `boot_diag_storage_account` (string) - Specify storage to store Boot Diagnostics -- Enabling this option
  will create 2 Files in the specified storage account. (serial console log & screehshot file)
  once the build is completed, it has to be removed manually.
  see [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/troubleshooting/boot-diagnostics) for more info

- `custom_resource_build_prefix` (string) - specify custom azure resource names during build limited to max 10 characters
  this will set the prefix for the resources. The actuall resource names will be
  `custom_resource_build_prefix` + resourcetype + 5 character random alphanumeric string

- `async_resourcegroup_delete` (bool) - If you want packer to delete the
  temporary resource group asynchronously set this value. It's a boolean
  value and defaults to false. Important Setting this true means that
  your builds are faster, however any failed deletes are not reported.
