- `destination` (string) - The path on the local machine to store a copy of the SBOM file.
  You can specify an absolute or a path relative to the working directory
  when you execute the Packer build. If the file already exists on the
  local machine, Packer overwrites the file. If the destination is a
  directory, the directory must already exist.

- `sbom_name` (string) - The name of the SBOM file stored in HCP Packer.
  If omitted, HCP Packer uses the build fingerprint as the file name.
  This value must be between three and 36 characters from the following set: `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`.
  You must specify a unique name for each build in an artifact version.
