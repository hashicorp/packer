- `destination` (string) - Destination is an optional field that specifies the path where the SBOM
  file will be downloaded to for the user.
  The 'Destination' must be a writable location. If the destination is a file,
  the SBOM will be saved or overwritten at that path. If the destination is
  a directory, a file will be created within the directory to store the SBOM.
  Any parent directories for the destination must already exist and be
  writable by the provisioning user (generally not root), otherwise,
  a "Permission Denied" error will occur. If the source path is a file,
  it is recommended that the destination path be a file as well.
