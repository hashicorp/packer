- `source` (string) - The path to a local file or directory to upload to the
  machine. The path can be absolute or relative. If it is relative, it is
  relative to the working directory when Packer is executed. If this is a
  directory, the existence of a trailing slash is important. Read below on
  uploading directories. Mandatory unless `sources` is set.

- `destination` (string) - The path where the file will be uploaded to in the machine. This value
  must be a writable location and any parent directories
  must already exist. If the provisioning user (generally not root) cannot
  write to this directory, you will receive a "Permission Denied" error.
  If the source is a file, it's a good idea to make the destination a file
  as well, but if you set your destination as a directory, at least make
  sure that the destination ends in a trailing slash so that Packer knows
  to use the source's basename in the final upload path. Failure to do so
  may cause Packer to fail on file uploads. If the destination file
  already exists, it will be overwritten.
