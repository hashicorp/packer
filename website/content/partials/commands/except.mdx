- `-except=foo,bar,baz` - Run all the builds and post-processors except those
  with the given comma-separated names. In legacy JSON templates, build names default to the
  types of their builders (e.g. `docker` or
  `amazon-ebs` or `virtualbox-iso`), unless a specific `name` attribute is
  specified within the configuration. In HCL2 templates, the "name" is the
  source block's "name" label, unless an in-build source definition adds the
  "name" configuration option. Any post-processor following
  a skipped post-processor will not run. Because post-processors can be nested
  in arrays a different post-processor chain can still run. A post-processor
  with an empty name will be ignored.
