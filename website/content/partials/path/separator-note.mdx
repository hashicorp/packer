~> **Note:** If possible, try to always use a forward slash `/` as the path separator,
especially when dealing with relative paths. A backward slash `\` will work on
Windows and is the official Windows path separator, but when building from any
system that is not Windows, Packer will only treat slashes `/` as path
separators, and treat backslashes as plain text. Which could lead to pathing
errors.
