- `boot_keygroup_interval` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - Time to wait after sending a group of key pressses. The value of this
  should be a duration. Examples are `5s` and `1m30s` which will cause
  Packer to wait five seconds and one minute 30 seconds, respectively. If
  this isn't specified, a sensible default value is picked depending on
  the builder type.

- `boot_wait` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - The time to wait after booting the initial virtual machine before typing
  the `boot_command`. The value of this should be a duration. Examples are
  `5s` and `1m30s` which will cause Packer to wait five seconds and one
  minute 30 seconds, respectively. If this isn't specified, the default is
  `10s` or 10 seconds. To set boot_wait to 0s, use a negative number, such
  as "-1s"

- `boot_command` ([]string) - This is an array of commands to type when the virtual machine is first
  booted. The goal of these commands should be to type just enough to
  initialize the operating system installer. Special keys can be typed as
  well, and are covered in the section below on the boot command. If this
  is not specified, it is assumed the installer will start itself.
