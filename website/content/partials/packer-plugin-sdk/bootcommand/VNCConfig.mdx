The boot command "typed" character for character over a VNC connection to
the machine, simulating a human actually typing the keyboard.

Keystrokes are typed as separate key up/down events over VNC with a default
100ms delay. The delay alleviates issues with latency and CPU contention.
You can tune this delay on a per-builder basis by specifying
"boot_key_interval" in your Packer template.
