An iso (CD) containing custom files can be made available for your build.

By default, no extra CD will be attached. All files listed in this setting
get placed into the root directory of the CD and the CD is attached as the
second CD device.

This config exists to work around modern operating systems that have no
way to mount floppy disks, which was our previous go-to for adding files at
boot time.
