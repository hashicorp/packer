- `floppy_files` ([]string) - A list of files to place onto a floppy disk that is attached when the VM
  is booted. Currently, no support exists for creating sub-directories on
  the floppy. Wildcard characters (\\*, ?, and \[\]) are allowed. Directory
  names are also allowed, which will add all the files found in the
  directory to the floppy.

- `floppy_dirs` ([]string) - A list of directories to place onto the floppy disk recursively. This is
  similar to the `floppy_files` option except that the directory structure
  is preserved. This is useful for when your floppy disk includes drivers
  or if you just want to organize it's contents as a hierarchy. Wildcard
  characters (\\*, ?, and \[\]) are allowed. The maximum summary size of
  all files in the listed directories are the same as in `floppy_files`.

- `floppy_label` (string) - Floppy Label
