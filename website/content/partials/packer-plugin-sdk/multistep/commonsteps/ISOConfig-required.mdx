- `iso_checksum` (string) - The checksum for the ISO file or virtual hard drive file. The type of
  the checksum is specified within the checksum field as a prefix, ex:
  "md5:{$checksum}". The type of the checksum can also be omitted and
  Packer will try to infer it based on string length. Valid values are
  "none", "{$checksum}", "md5:{$checksum}", "sha1:{$checksum}",
  "sha256:{$checksum}", "sha512:{$checksum}" or "file:{$path}". Here is a
  list of valid checksum values:
   * md5:090992ba9fd140077b0661cb75f7ce13
   * 090992ba9fd140077b0661cb75f7ce13
   * sha1:ebfb681885ddf1234c18094a45bbeafd91467911
   * ebfb681885ddf1234c18094a45bbeafd91467911
   * sha256:ed363350696a726b7932db864dda019bd2017365c9e299627830f06954643f93
   * ed363350696a726b7932db864dda019bd2017365c9e299627830f06954643f93
   * file:http://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/SHA256SUMS
   * file:file://./local/path/file.sum
   * file:./local/path/file.sum
   * none
  Although the checksum will not be verified when it is set to "none",
  this is not recommended since these files can be very large and
  corruption does happen from time to time.

- `iso_url` (string) - A URL to the ISO containing the installation image or virtual hard drive
  (VHD or VHDX) file to clone.
