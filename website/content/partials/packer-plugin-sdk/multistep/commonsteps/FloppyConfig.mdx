A floppy can be made available for your build. This is most useful for
unattended Windows installs, which look for an Autounattend.xml file on
removable media. By default, no floppy will be attached. All files listed in
this setting get placed into the root directory of the floppy and the floppy
is attached as the first floppy device. The summary size of the listed files
must not exceed 1.44 MB. The supported ways to move large files into the OS
are using `http_directory` or [the file
provisioner](/docs/provisioners/file).
