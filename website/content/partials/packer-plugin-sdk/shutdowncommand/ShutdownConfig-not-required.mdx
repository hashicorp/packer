<!-- Code generated from the comments of the ShutdownConfig struct in shutdowncommand/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `shutdown_command` (string) - The command to use to gracefully shut down the machine once all
  provisioning is complete. By default this is an empty string, which
  tells Packer to just forcefully shut down the machine. This setting can
  be safely omitted if for example, a shutdown command to gracefully halt
  the machine is configured inside a provisioning script. If one or more
  scripts require a reboot it is suggested to leave this blank (since
  reboots may fail) and instead specify the final shutdown command in your
  last script.

- `shutdown_timeout` (duration string | ex: "1h5m2s") - The amount of time to wait after executing the shutdown_command for the
  virtual machine to actually shut down. If the machine doesn't shut down
  in this time it is considered an error. By default, the time out is "5m"
  (five minutes).
