<!-- Code generated from the comments of the ShutdownConfig struct in shutdowncommand/config.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

ShutdownConfig defines implementation details for shutting down a VM once it
is done being provisioned.

It is provided as a convenience to encourage builder developers to
consider implementing these options, which we believe are valuable for all
builders. It also helps guarantee that option names for similar options
are the same across the various builders. Embed it in your builder config
using the `mapstructure:",squash"` struct tag.
