- `ssh_interface` (string) - One of `public_ip`, `private_ip`, `public_dns`, or `private_dns`. If
  set, either the public IP address, private IP address, public DNS name
  or private DNS name will used as the host for SSH. The default behaviour
  if inside a VPC is to use the public IP address if available, otherwise
  the private IP address will be used. If not in a VPC the public DNS name
  will be used. Also works for WinRM.
  
  Where Packer is configured for an outbound proxy but WinRM traffic
  should be direct, `ssh_interface` must be set to `private_dns` and
  `<region>.compute.internal` included in the `NO_PROXY` environment
  variable.

- `ssh_ip_version` (string) - The IP version to use for SSH connections, valid values are `4` and `6`.
  Useful on dual stacked instances where the default behavior is to
  connect via whichever IP address is returned first from the OpenStack
  API.
