The reference of available configuration options is listed below. The only
required element is either "inline" or "script". Every other option is
optional.

Exactly _one_ of the following is required:

- `inline` (array of strings) - This is an array of commands to execute. The
  commands are concatenated by newlines and turned into a single file, so
  they are all executed within the same context. This allows you to change
  directories in one command and use something in the directory in the next
  and so on. Inline scripts are the easiest way to pull off simple tasks
  within the machine.

- `script` (string) - The path to a script to upload and execute in the
  machine. This path can be absolute or relative. If it is relative, it is
  relative to the working directory when Packer is executed.

- `scripts` (array of strings) - An array of scripts to execute. The scripts
  will be uploaded and executed in the order specified. Each script is
  executed in isolation, so state such as variables from one script won't
  carry on to the next.

Optional parameters:

- `binary` (boolean) - If true, specifies that the script(s) are binary
  files, and Packer should therefore not convert Windows line endings to Unix
  line endings (if there are any). By default this is false.

- `valid_exit_codes` (list of ints) - Valid exit codes for the script. By
  default this is just 0.
