-> **Note:** This page is about HCL2 Packer templates. HCL2 templates
were first introduced as a beta feature into Packer version 1.5. As of v1.7,
HCL2 support is no longer in beta, and is the preferred way to write Packer
configuration. For the old-style stable configuration language see
[template docs](/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates). As of v1.6.2, you can
convert your legacy JSON template into an HCL2 config file using the
[hcl2_upgrade command](/docs/commands/hcl2_upgrade).
