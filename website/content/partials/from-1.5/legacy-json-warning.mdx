-> **Note:** This page is about older-style JSON Packer templates. JSON
templates are still supported by the Packer core, but new features added to the
Packer core may not be implemented for JSON templates. We recommend you
transition to HCL templates as soon as is convenient for you, in order to have
the best possible experience with Packer. To help you upgrade your templates,
we have written an [hcl2_upgrade command](/docs/commands/hcl2_upgrade) command.
