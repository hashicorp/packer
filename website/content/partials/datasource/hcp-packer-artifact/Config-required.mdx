- `bucket_name` (string) - The name of the bucket your artifact is in.

- `channel_name` (string) - The name of the channel to use when retrieving your artifact.
  Either `channel_name` or `version_fingerprint` MUST be set.
  If using several artifacts from a single version, you may prefer sourcing a version first,
  and referencing it for subsequent uses, as every `hcp_packer_artifact` with the channel set will generate a
  potentially billable HCP Packer request, but if several `hcp_packer_artifact`s use a shared `hcp_packer_version`
  that will only generate one potentially billable request.

- `version_fingerprint` (string) - The fingerprint of the version to use when retrieving your artifact.
  Either this or `channel_name` MUST be set.
  Mutually exclusive with `channel_name`

- `platform` (string) - The name of the platform that your artifact is for.
  For example, "aws", "azure", or "gce".

- `region` (string) - The name of the region your artifact is in.
  For example "us-east-1".
