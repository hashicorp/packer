- `contents` (string) - The contents of the file to create
  
  This is useful especially for files that involve templating so that
  Packer can dynamically create files and expose them for later importing
  as attributes in another entity.
  
  If no contents are specified, the resulting file will be empty.

- `destination` (string) - The file or directory to write the contents to.
