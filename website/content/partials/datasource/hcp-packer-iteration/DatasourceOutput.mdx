<!-- Code generated from the comments of the DatasourceOutput struct in datasource/hcp-packer-iteration/data.go; DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY -->

- `author_id` (string) - who created the iteration

- `bucket_name` (string) - Name of the bucket that the iteration was retrieved from

- `complete` (bool) - If true, this iteration is considered "ready to use" and will be
  returned even if the include_incomplete flag is "false" in the
  list iterations request. Note that if you are retrieving an iteration
  using a channel, this will always be "true"; channels cannot be assigned
  to incomplete iterations.

- `created_at` (string) - The date the iteration was created.

- `fingerprint` (string) - The fingerprint of the build; this could be a git sha or other unique
  identifier as set by the Packer build that created this iteration.

- `id` (string) - The iteration ID. This is a ULID, which is a unique identifier similar
  to a UUID. It is created by the HCP Packer Registry when an iteration is
  first created, and is unique to this iteration.

- `incremental_version` (int32) - The version number assigned to an iteration. This number is an integer,
  and is created by the HCP Packer Registry once an iteration is
  marked "complete". If a new iteration is marked "complete", the version
  that HCP Packer assigns to it will always be the highest previous
  iteration version plus one.

- `updated_at` (string) - The date when this iteration was last updated.

- `channel_id` (string) - The ID of the channel used to query the image iteration.
