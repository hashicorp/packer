- `created_at` (string) - The date and time at which the build was last updated.

- `id` (string) - The iteration id. This is a ULID, which is a unique identifier similar
  to a UUID. It is created by the HCP Packer Registry when an iteration is
  first created, and is unique to this iteration.

- `image_id` (string) - ID or URL of the remote cloud image as given by a build.

- `region` (string) - The cloud region as given by `packer build`. eg. "ap-east-1".
  For locally managed clouds, this may map instead to a cluster, server
  or datastore.
