- `Id` (string) - The iteration id. This is a ULID, which is a unique identifier similar
  to a UUID. It is created by the HCP Packer Registry when an iteration is
  first created, and is unique to this iteration.

- `incremental_version` (int32) - The version number assigned to an iteration. This number is an integer,
  and is created by the HCP Packer Registry once an iteration is
  marked "complete". If a new iteration is marked "complete", the version
  that HCP Packer assigns to it will always be the highest previous
  iteration version plus one.

- `created_at` (string) - The date the iteration was created.

- `builds` ([]ParBuild) - A list of builds that are stored in the iteration. These builds can be
  parsed using HCL to find individual image ids for specific providers.
