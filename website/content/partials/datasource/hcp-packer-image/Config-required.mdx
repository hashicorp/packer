- `bucket_name` (string) - The name of the bucket your image is in.

  Either this or `iteration_id` MUST be set.
  Mutually exclusive with `iteration_id`.
  If using several images from a single iteration, you may prefer
  sourcing an iteration first, and referencing it for subsequent uses,
  as every `hcp-packer-image` with the channel set will generate a
  potentially billable HCP Packer request, but if several
  `hcp-packer-image`s use a shared `hcp-packer-iteration` that will
  only generate one potentially billable request.

- `iteration_id` (string) - The ID of the iteration to use when retrieving your image
  Either this or `channel` MUST be set.
  Mutually exclusive with `channel`

- `cloud_provider` (string) - The name of the cloud provider that your image is for. For example,
  "aws" or "gce".

- `region` (string) - The name of the cloud region your image is in. For example "us-east-1".
