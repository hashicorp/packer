# Packer plugins

Packer Plugins allow new functionality to be added to Packer without modifying
the core source code. Packer plugins are able to add new components to Packer,
such as builders, provisioners, post-processors, and data sources.

This page documents how to use plugins.

If you're interested in developing plugins, see the [developing
plugins](/docs/plugins/creation#developing-plugins) page.

On the left hand side of this page, you can find the available Packer plugins,
not all of them are 'official'.
