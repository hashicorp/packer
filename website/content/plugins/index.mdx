# Packer plugins

Plugins let you extend Packer functionality without modifying the core source code. Packer plugins can add new components to Packer, such as builders, provisioners, post-processors, and data sources. Refer to [How Plugins Work](/docs/plugins#how-plugins-work) for more details.

This section contains the documentation for available Packer plugins. For information about developing plugins, refer to the [developing
plugins](/docs/plugins/creation#developing-plugins) documentation.
