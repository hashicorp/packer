# Packer v1.12 release notes

This page describes changes to Packer in v1.12. Refer to the [Packer repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/releases) for information about all releases.

## New features

This release includes the following updates.

### HCP Packer SBOM Support

In Packer 1.12, you can upload software bill of materials (SBOMs) to HCP Packer and associate it with an artifact version.
SBOMs are a standardized way to export information about a system.
In Packer's case, the generally useful information that you may find in a SBOM for an artifact is the list of installed packages, along with extra information on the system built: OS, version, kernel, architecture, etc.

While we support uploading SBOMs to HCP Packer as part of a build, we do not offer a special-purpose provisioner or tooling to produce them.
Instead we encourage you to use a third-party scanner to produce the SBOM on the VM you are provisioning, and then you can use the [`hcp-sbom` provisioner](https://developer.hashicorp.com/packer/docs/provisioners/hcp-sbom) to upload it when your Packer build completes.

### Data source and Locals evaluation order changes

Older versions of Packer used a phase-based approach, where it evaluated data sources first, then local variables.
This made it impossible for a data source to reference a local variable.

Packer 1.12 introduces a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) approach to evaluating data sources and locals.
This loosens the dependency order between those components, and now you can reference them from both contexts.

This change is a step in the direction of a complete pivot to using a DAG for evaluating everything in a Packer build, along with the other improvements this can yield in future releases.

### Serialisation format upgrades for Packer-Plugin communication

More than one year ago, a dependency of ours (`go-cty`) dropped support for `gob` encoding.
This made it impossible for plugin developers to upgrade to more recent versions of the HCL2 libraries, because otherwise their plugin became incapable to commuinicate with Packer.
We temporarily addressed this issue by forking the `go-cty` repository, and introduced replacement directives to every Packer plugin.
While this fix was functional, it was not desirable as a long-term solution, and instead we were looking for a more permanent fix.

Now, when Packer communicates with plugins, it swaps to using a protobuf/msgpack hybrid approach instead of relying on `gob`.
We are introducing this change now in a non-breaking way: all the currently supported plugins are expected to continue working with Packer for the time being, and changing to using this new serialization approach will be transparent to you.

### New HCL2 functions

As part of Packer 1.12, we have introduced more functions that can be used in HCL2 templates, and one (`aws_secretsmanager_raw`) that can be used both in legacy JSON and HCL2 templates.

* `anytrue`: check that a collection contains at least one `true` value.
* `alltrue`: check that a collection contains only `true` values.
* `aws_secretsmanager_raw`: get a raw secret from AWS Secrets Manager. Unlike `aws_secretsmanager`, this works with all types.
* `base64gzip`: gzip compress a binary blob and expose it as a base64-encoded `string` to be used elsewhere in a template.
* `strcontains`: checks that a string contains another.

### `HTTP` data source support methods other than `GET`

The HTTP data source, embedded with Packer, lets you retrieve data over HTTP from a remote server.
Previous versions of Packer only supported `GET` to do so. Packer 1.12 loosens this by allowing for: `HEAD`, `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `OPTIONS` and `PATCH`.

## Bug fixes

### Include LC_UUID in macOS binaries

Users of macOS started having permission-related problems when using Packer, after upgrading their OS versions.
This problem was caused by an update to macOS's network-usage policies, where binaries that want to use the local loop interface to communicate over the network must now include a valid UUID.
Starting with Packer 1.12, all macOS binaries include a valid LC_UUID, fixing this.

### Less duplication of error messages in HCL2 templates

If a template has an error in its top-level HCL2 template, Packer produces a parsing error.
This is expected behavior when you write a Packer template: the tool helps you by pointing out grammar violations so you can remediate them.
However, for a subset of HCL-related errors, older versions of Packer displayed the same message up to five times.
Thanks to a community contribution, starting with Packer 1.12 we now no longer experience this.
