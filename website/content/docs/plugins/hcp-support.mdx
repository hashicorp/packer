# HCP Packer Support

~> **Note:** HCP Packer is under active development, and we suggest plugin maintainers to keep up with the SDK changes
for more on HCP Packer support.

~> **Note:** If you're looking to develop a new plugin, please refer first to the [developing
plugins](/docs/plugins/creation#developing-plugins) page.

HCP Packer support allows for the management of image metadata that can be stored in a HCP Packer registry.
Before pushing metadata to the HCP Packer registry, Packer will use the [`par.artifact.metadata` key](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/packer-plugin-sdk/packer/registry/image#pkg-constants)
to query a builder artifact for the Image metadata that a particular component would like to have stored in the registry.

For details and usage examples on management of image metadata, see the [Documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/packer-plugin-sdk/packer/registry/image).

## Builder Artifact

To support HCP Packer, changes must be made to the plugin's build artifact. The artifact should keep the appropriate
Image metadata in state under the key `par.artifact.metadata`. The expected key is provided by the [image.ArtifactStateURI](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/packer-plugin-sdk/packer/registry/image#pkg-constants) constant.

To make HCP Packer support easier, we ship an Image package with the [packer-plugin-sdk](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/packer-plugin-sdk/packer/registry/image#pkg-overview).
We provide the [`FromArtifact`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/packer-plugin-sdk/packer/registry/image#FromArtifact) function
to easily create an Image with the basic information contained in the Artifact. If customization is necessary, the `FromArtifact` accepts
override functions as the second argument, and that can be used to set different values for the metadata.

The [Image metadata](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/hashicorp/packer-plugin-sdk/packer/registry/image#Image) must contain every
metadata HCP Packer should store about this component. The structure is:
```go
// Image represents the metadata for some Artifact in the HCP Packer Registry.
type Image struct {
	// ImageID is a unique reference identifier stored on the HCP Packer registry
	// that can be used to get back the built artifact of a builder or post-processor.
	ImageID string
	// ProviderName represents the name of the top level cloud or service where the built artifact resides.
	// For example "aws, azure, docker, gcp, and vsphere".
	ProviderName string
	// ProviderRegion represents the location of the built artifact.
	// For cloud providers region usually maps to a cloud region or zone, but for things like the file builder,
	// S3 bucket or vsphere cluster region can represent a path on the upstream datastore, or cluster.
	ProviderRegion string
	// Labels represents additional details about an image that a builder or post-processor may with to provide for a given build.
	// Any additional metadata will be made available as build labels within a HCP Packer registry iteration.
	Labels map[string]string
	// SourceImageID is the cloud image id of the image that was used as the
	// source for this image. If set, the HCP Packer registry will be able
	// link the parent and child images for ancestry visualizations and
	// dependency tracking.
	SourceImageID string
}
```

Where `ImageID`, `ProviderName`, and `SourceImageID` are mandatory fields.

Examples using the `FromArtifact` method:

- Simple form:
```go
func (a *Artifact) State(name string) interface{} {
	if name == registryimage.ArtifactStateURI {
		img, err := registryimage.FromArtifact(a)
		if err != nil {
			log.Printf("[DEBUG] error encountered when creating a registry image %v", err)
			return nil
		}
	  return img
	}
	return a.StateData[name]
}
```

- Using overrides:
```go
func (a *Artifact) State(name string) interface{} {
	if name == registryimage.ArtifactStateURI {
		img, err := registryimage.FromArtifact(a,
                registryimage.WithID(a.Name),
                registryimage.WithRegion(a.Region.Name()),
                registryimage.WithProvider("happy-cloud"),
                registryimage.WithSourceID(a.SourceID),
                registryimage.SetLabels(a.Labels),
              )
		if err != nil {
			log.Printf("[DEBUG] error encountered when creating a registry image %v", err)
			return nil
		}
	  return img
	}
	return a.StateData[name]
}
```
