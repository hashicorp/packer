# Packer Plugins

Packer plugins perform tasks during each build.

During a `packer build`, the process list shows `packer-` prefixed applications. One of those applications is the Packer binary, and the rest are plugins. Packer launches one plugin process for each component in the build.

The set of builders, provisioners, and post-processors bundled with the Packer binary function as plugins that Packer finds and runs automatically. You can also define a list of external plugins in your template. These external plugins are separate, standalone applications that extend Packer functionality without modifying the core source code.

## External Plugins

Refer to the following resources:
- [External Plugins](/plugins): Documentation for available packer plugins
- [Install Plugins](/plugins/install-plugins): Add external plugins to your packer template


## Develop Plugins

Packer plugins can add new components to Packer, such as builders, provisioners, post-processors, and data sources. Refer to the following resources. Refer to [Development Overview](/docs/plugins/creation) to get started.

## HCP Packer Support

If you want your plugin to support HCP Packer, refer to the [HCP
support](/docs/plugins/hcp-support) page.
