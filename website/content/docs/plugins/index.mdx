# External Packer Plugins

Plugins let you extend Packer functionality without modifying the core source code. Packer plugins can add new components to Packer, such as builders, provisioners, post-processors, and data sources.

This page documents how to install plugins. You can find a list of available
plugins in the [Plugins section](/plugins).

If you're interested in developing plugins, see the [developing
plugins](/docs/plugins/creation#developing-plugins) page.

If you're a plugin maintainer interested in supporting HCP Packer, see the [HCP
support](/docs/plugins/hcp-support) page.
