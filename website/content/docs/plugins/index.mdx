# Packer Plugins

Packer plugins perform tasks during each build.

During a `packer build`, the process list shows `packer-` prefixed applications. One of those applications is the Packer binary, and the rest are plugins. Packer launches one plugin process for each component in the build.

The set of builders, provisioners, and post-processors bundled with the Packer binary function as plugins that Packer finds and runs automatically. You can also define a list of external plugins in your template for Packer to start and communiate with throughout the build. These external plugins are separate, standalone applications that extend Packer functionality without modifying the core source code.

## External Plugins

Refer to [External Plugins](/plugins) to review the documentation for available packer plugins. Refer to [Install Plugins](/docs/plugins/install-plugins) for details about adding external plugins to your Packer template.
