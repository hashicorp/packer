# Windows Restart Provisioner

Type: `windows-restart`

The Windows restart provisioner initiates a reboot on a Windows machine and
waits for the machine to come back online.

The Windows provisioning process often requires multiple reboots, and this
provisioner helps to ease that process.

Packer expects the machine to be ready to continue provisioning after it
reboots. Packer detects that the reboot has completed by making an RPC call
through the Windows Remote Management (WinRM) service, not by ACPI functions,
so Windows must be completely booted in order to continue.

## Basic Example

The example below is fully functional.

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="JSON">

```json
{
  "type": "windows-restart"
}
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="HCL2">

```hcl
provisioner "windows-restart" {}
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Configuration Reference

The reference of available configuration options is listed below.

Optional parameters:

- `check_registry` (bool) - if `true`, checks for several registry keys that
  indicate that the system is going to reboot. This is useful if an
  installation kicks off a reboot and you want the provisioner to wait for
  that reboot to complete before reconnecting. Please note that this option
  is a beta feature, and we generally recommend that you finish installs that
  auto-reboot (like windows updates) during your autounattend phase before
  our winrm provisioner connects.

- `registry_keys` (array of strings) - if `check-registry` is `true`,
  windows-restart will not reconnect until after all of the listed keys are
  no longer present in the registry.

  default:

      var DefaultRegistryKeys = []string{
        "HKLM:SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Component Based Servicing\\RebootPending",
        "HKLM:SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Component Based Servicing\\PackagesPending",
        "HKLM:Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Component Based Servicing\\RebootInProgress",
      }

- `restart_command` (string) - The command to execute to initiate the
  restart. By default this is `shutdown /r /f /t 0 /c "packer restart"`.

- `restart_check_command` (string) - A command to execute to check if the
  restart succeeded. This will be done in a loop. Example usage:

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="JSON">

```json
{
  "type": "windows-restart",
  "restart_check_command": "powershell -command \"& {Write-Output 'restarted.'}\""
}
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="HCL2">

```hcl
provisioner "windows-restart" {
  restart_check_command = "powershell -command \"& {Write-Output 'restarted.'}\""
}
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

- `restart_timeout` (string) - The timeout to wait for the restart. By
  default this is 5 minutes. Example value: `5m`. If you are installing
  updates or have a lot of startup services, you will probably need to
  increase this duration.
