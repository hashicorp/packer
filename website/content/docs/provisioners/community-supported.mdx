# Community Provisioners

The following provisioners are developed and maintained by various members of the
Packer community, not by HashiCorp. For more information on how to use community
provisioners, refer to [Developing Plugins](/packer/docs/plugins/creation).

- [Comment Provisioner](https://github.com/SwampDragons/packer-provisioner-comment) -
  Example provisioner that allows you to annotate your build with bubble-text
  comments.

- [Windows Update provisioner](https://github.com/rgl/packer-plugin-windows-update) -
  A provisioner for gracefully handling Windows updates and the reboots they
  cause.

- [S3 Provisioner](https://github.com/spacechunks/packer-plugin-s3) - 
  A provisioner that retrieves objects from S3 and stores them at a given destination.
