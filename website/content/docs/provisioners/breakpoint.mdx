# `breakpoint` provisioner

The `breakpoint` provisioner pauses the build operation until you press the Enter key to resume the build. Use the `breakpoint` provisioner to help you debug errors.

Alternatively, you can add the [`-debug` flag](/packer/docs/commands/build#debug) when running your build to halt the operation at every step and between every provisioner. 

## Basic Example

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="HCL2">

```hcl
source "null" "example" {
  communicator = "none"
}

build {
  sources = ["source.null.example"]

  provisioner "shell-local" {
    inline = ["echo hi"]
  }
  provisioner "breakpoint" {
    disable = false
    note    = "this is a breakpoint"
  }
  provisioner "shell-local" {
    inline = ["echo hi 2"]
  }
}
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="JSON">

```json
{
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "null",
      "communicator": "none"
    }
  ],
  "provisioners": [
    {
      "type": "shell-local",
      "inline": "echo hi"
    },
    {
      "type": "breakpoint",
      "disable": false,
      "note": "this is a breakpoint"
    },
    {
      "type": "shell-local",
      "inline": "echo hi 2"
    }
  ]
}
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Configuration Reference

### Optional

- `disable` (boolean) - If `true`, skip the breakpoint. Useful for when you
  have set multiple breakpoints and want to toggle them off or on. Default:
  `false`

- `note` (string) - a string to include explaining the purpose or location of
  the breakpoint. For example, you may find it useful to number your
  breakpoints or label them with information about where in the build they
  occur

@include 'provisioners/common-config.mdx'

## Usage

Insert this provisioner wherever you want the build to pause. You'll see ui
output prompting you to press "enter" to continue the build when you are ready.

For example:

```shell-session
==> docker: Pausing at breakpoint provisioner with note "foo bar baz".
==> docker: Press enter to continue.
```

Once you press enter, the build will resume and run normally until it either
completes or errors.
