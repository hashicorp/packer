# Ansible Local Provisioner

Type: `ansible-local`

The `ansible-local` Packer provisioner will run ansible in ansible's "local"
mode on the remote/guest VM using Playbook and Role files that exist on the
guest VM. This means ansible must be installed on the remote/guest VM.
Playbooks and Roles can be uploaded from your build machine (the one running
Packer) to the vm. Ansible is then run on the guest machine in [local
mode](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbooks_delegation.html#local-playbooks)
via the `ansible-playbook` command.

-> **Note:** Ansible will _not_ be installed automatically by this
provisioner. This provisioner expects that Ansible is already installed on the
guest/remote machine. It is common practice to use the [shell
provisioner](/docs/provisioners/shell) before the Ansible provisioner to
do this.

## Basic Example

The example below is fully functional.

<Tab heading="JSON">

```json
{
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "docker",
      "image": "williamyeh/ansible:ubuntu14.04",
      "export_path": "packer_example",
      "run_command": ["-d", "-i", "-t", "--entrypoint=/bin/bash", "{{.Image}}"]
    }
  ],
  "variables": {
    "topping": "mushroom"
  },
  "provisioners": [
    {
      "type": "ansible-local",
      "playbook_file": "./playbook.yml",
      "extra_arguments": [
        "--extra-vars",
        "\"pizza_toppings={{ user `topping`}}\""
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="HCL2">

```hcl
variable "topping" {
  type    = string
  default = "mushroom"
}

source "docker" "example" {
  image       = "williamyeh/ansible:ubuntu14.04"
  export_path = "packer_example"
  run_command = ["-d", "-i", "-t", "--entrypoint=/bin/bash", "{{.Image}}"]
}

build {
  sources = [
    "source.docker.example"
  ]

  provisioner "ansible-local" {
    playbook_file   = "./playbook.yml"
    extra_arguments = ["--extra-vars", "\"pizza_toppings=${var.topping}\""]
  }
}
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

where ./playbook.yml contains

```
---
- name: hello world
  hosts: 127.0.0.1
  connection: local

  tasks:
    - command: echo {{ pizza_toppings }}
    - debug: msg="{{ pizza_toppings }}"

```

## Configuration Reference

The reference of available configuration options is listed below.

Note that one of `playbook_file` or `playbook_files` is required.

@include '/provisioner/ansible/Config-not-required.mdx'

@include 'provisioners/common-config.mdx'

## Default Extra Variables

In addition to being able to specify extra arguments using the
`extra_arguments` configuration, the provisioner automatically defines certain
commonly useful Ansible variables:

- `packer_build_name` is set to the name of the build that Packer is running.
  This is most useful when Packer is making multiple builds and you want to
  distinguish them slightly when using a common playbook.

- `packer_builder_type` is the type of the builder that was used to create
  the machine that the script is running on. This is useful if you want to
  run only certain parts of the playbook on systems built with certain
  builders.

- `packer_http_addr` If using a builder that provides an http server for file
  transfer (such as hyperv, parallels, qemu, virtualbox, and vmware), this
  will be set to the address. You can use this address in your provisioner to
  download large files over http. This may be useful if you're experiencing
  slower speeds using the default file provisioner. A file provisioner using
  the `winrm` communicator may experience these types of difficulties.
