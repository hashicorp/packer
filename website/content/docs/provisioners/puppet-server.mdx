# Puppet Server Provisioner

@include 'provisioners/unmaintained-plugin.mdx'

Type: `puppet-server`

The `puppet-server` Packer provisioner provisions Packer machines with Puppet
by connecting to a Puppet master.

-> **Note:** Puppet will _not_ be installed automatically by this
provisioner. This provisioner expects that Puppet is already installed on the
machine. It is common practice to use the [shell
provisioner](/docs/provisioners/shell) before the Puppet provisioner to do
this.

## Basic Example

The example below is fully functional and expects a Puppet server to be
accessible from your network.

```json
{
  "type": "puppet-server",
  "extra_arguments": "--test --pluginsync",
  "facter": {
    "server_role": "webserver"
  }
}
```

## Configuration Reference

The reference of available configuration options is listed below.

The provisioner takes various options. None are strictly required. They are
listed below:

- `client_cert_path` (string) - Path to the directory on your disk that
  contains the client certificate for the node. This defaults to nothing, in
  which case a client cert won't be uploaded.

- `client_private_key_path` (string) - Path to the directory on your disk
  that contains the client private key for the node. This defaults to
  nothing, in which case a client private key won't be uploaded.

- `execute_command` (string) - The command-line to execute Puppet. This is a
  [template engine](/docs/templates/engine). Therefore, you
  may use user variables and template functions in this field. In addition,
  you may use the following extra variables:
  - ClientCertPath: The value set in the template option
    `client_cert_path`.
  - ClientPrivateKeyPath: The value set in the template option
    `client_private_key_path`.
  - FacterVars: Additional facts to set when executing Puppet, joined for
    use in a command. This is internal and not settable by the user.
  - PuppetNode: The hostname of the Puppet node, set in `puppet_node`.
  - PuppetServer: The hostname of the Puppet server, set in `puppet_server`
  - PuppetBinDir: The directory that the Puppet binary is in.
  - Sudo: Returns false when PreventSudo is set, and true when it is not.
  - WorkingDir: The value provided in the `working_directory` option.
    See below for `execute_command`'s default value.

* `extra_arguments` (array of strings) - Additional options to pass to the
  Puppet command. This allows for customization of `execute_command` without
  having to completely replace or subsume its contents, making
  forward-compatible customizations much easier to maintain.

  This string is lazy-evaluated so one can incorporate logic driven by
  template variables as well as private elements of ExecuteTemplate (see
  source: provisioner/puppet-server/provisioner.go).

  ```text
  [
    {{if ne "{{user environment}}" ""}}--environment={{user environment}}{{end}}
  ]
  ```

* `facter` (object of key/value strings) - Additional
  [facts](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/facter.html) to make available to the Puppet run.

* `guest_os_type` (string) - The remote host's OS type ('windows' or 'unix')
  to tailor command-line and path separators. (default: unix).

* `ignore_exit_codes` (boolean) - If true, Packer will ignore failures.

* `prevent_sudo` (boolean) - On Unix platforms Puppet is typically invoked
  with `sudo`. If true, it will be omitted. (default: false)

* `puppet_bin_dir` (string) - Path to the Puppet binary. Ideally the program
  should be on the system (unix: `$PATH`, windows: `%PATH%`), but some
  builders (eg. Docker) do not run profile-setup scripts and therefore PATH
  might be empty or minimal. On Windows, spaces should be `^`-escaped, i.e.
  `c:/program^ files/puppet^ labs/puppet/bin`.

* `puppet_node` (string) - The name of the node. If this isn't set, the fully
  qualified domain name will be used.

* `puppet_server` (string) - Hostname of the Puppet server. By default
  "puppet" will be used.

* `staging_dir` (string) - Directory to where uploaded files will be placed
  (unix: "/tmp/packer-puppet-masterless", windows:
  "%SYSTEMROOT%/Temp/packer-puppet-masterless"). It doesn't need to
  pre-exist, but the parent must have permissions sufficient for the account
  Packer connects as to create directories and write files. Use a Shell
  provisioner to prepare the way if needed.

* `working_directory` (string) - Directory from which `execute_command` will
  be run. If using Hiera files with relative paths, this option can be
  helpful. (default: `staging_directory`)

* `elevated_user` and `elevated_password` (string) - If specified, Puppet
  will be run with elevated privileges using the given Windows user. See the
  [powershell](/docs/provisioners/powershell) provisioner for the full
  details. This is a [template engine](/docs/templates/engine).
  Therefore, you may use user variables and template functions in this
  field, including `` {{ build `Password`}} `` to use the password being used
  by the communicator to connect to your instance.

@include 'provisioners/common-config.mdx'

## Execute Command

By default, Packer uses the following command (broken across multiple lines for
readability) to execute Puppet:

```shell
cd {{.WorkingDir}} &&
    {{if ne .FacterVars ""}}{{.FacterVars}} {{end}}
    {{if .Sudo}}sudo -E {{end}}
    {{if ne .PuppetBinDir ""}}{{.PuppetBinDir}}/{{end}}
  puppet agent --onetime --no-daemonize --detailed-exitcodes
    {{if .Debug}}--debug {{end}}
    {{if ne .PuppetServer ""}}--server='{{.PuppetServer}}' {{end}}
    {{if ne .PuppetNode ""}}--certname='{{.PuppetNode}}' {{end}}
    {{if ne .ClientCertPath ""}}--certdir='{{.ClientCertPath}}' {{end}}
    {{if ne .ClientPrivateKeyPath ""}}--privatekeydir='{{.ClientPrivateKeyPath}}' {{end}}
    {{if ne .ExtraArguments ""}}{{.ExtraArguments}} {{end}}
```

The following command is used if guest OS type is windows:

```shell
cd {{.WorkingDir}} &&
    {{if ne .FacterVars ""}}{{.FacterVars}} && {{end}}
    {{if ne .PuppetBinDir ""}}{{.PuppetBinDir}}/{{end}}
  puppet agent --onetime --no-daemonize --detailed-exitcodes
    {{if .Debug}}--debug {{end}}
    {{if ne .PuppetServer ""}}--server='{{.PuppetServer}}' {{end}}
    {{if ne .PuppetNode ""}}--certname='{{.PuppetNode}}' {{end}}
    {{if ne .ClientCertPath ""}}--certdir='{{.ClientCertPath}}' {{end}}
    {{if ne .ClientPrivateKeyPath ""}}--privatekeydir='{{.ClientPrivateKeyPath}}' {{end}}
    {{if ne .ExtraArguments ""}}{{.ExtraArguments}} {{end}}
```

## Default Facts

In addition to being able to specify custom Facter facts using the `facter`
configuration, the provisioner automatically defines certain commonly useful
facts:

- `packer_build_name` is set to the name of the build that Packer is running.
  This is most useful when Packer is making multiple builds and you want to
  distinguish them in your Hiera hierarchy.

- `packer_builder_type` is the type of the builder that was used to create
  the machine that Puppet is running on. This is useful if you want to run
  only certain parts of your Puppet code on systems built with certain
  builders.
