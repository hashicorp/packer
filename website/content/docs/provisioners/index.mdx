# Provisioners

Provisioners use builtin and third-party software to install and configure the
machine image after booting. Provisioners prepare the system for use, so common
use cases for provisioners include:

- installing packages
- patching the kernel
- creating users
- downloading application code

See [Template Provisioners](/docs/templates/provisioners) to learn more
about working with provisioners. For information on an individual provisioner,
choose it from the sidebar.
