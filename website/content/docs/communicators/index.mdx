# Communicators

Communicators are the mechanism Packer uses to upload files, execute scripts,
etc. with the machine being created.

Communicators are configured within the
[builder](/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/builders) section. Packer currently supports
three kinds of communicators:

- `none` - No communicator will be used. If this is set, most provisioners
  also can't be used.

- [ssh](/docs/communicators/ssh) - An SSH connection will be established to the machine. This is
  usually the default.

- [winrm](/docs/communicators/winrm) - A WinRM connection will be established.

In addition to the above, some builders have custom communicators they can use.
For example, the Docker builder has a "docker" communicator that uses
`docker exec` and `docker cp` to execute scripts and copy files.

taken to each communicator's page.
