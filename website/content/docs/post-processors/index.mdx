# Post-Processors

Post-processors run after builders and provisioners. Post-processors are optional, and you can use them to upload artifacts, re-package files, and more. The documentation includes a page for each type of post-processor.

Refer to the [`post-processor`](/packer/docs/templates/hcl_templates/blocks/build/post-processor) and
[`post-processors`](/packer/docs/templates/hcl_templates/blocks/build/post-processors)
blocks documentation to learn more about working with post-processors.
