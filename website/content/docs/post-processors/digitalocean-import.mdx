# DigitalOcean Import Post-Processor

Type: `digitalocean-import`

The Packer DigitalOcean Import post-processor is used to import images created by other Packer builders to DigitalOcean.

~> Note: Users looking to create custom images, and reusable snapshots, directly on DigitalOcean can use
the [DigitalOcean builder](/docs/builders/digitalocean) without this post-processor.

## How Does it Work?

The import process operates uploading a temporary copy of the image to
DigitalOcean Spaces and then importing it as a custom image via the
DigialOcean API. The temporary copy in Spaces can be discarded after the
import is complete.

For information about the requirements to use an image for a DigitalOcean
Droplet, see DigitalOcean's [Custom Images documentation](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/images/custom-images/overview/).

## Configuration

There are some configuration options available for the post-processor.

Required:

- `api_token` (string) - A personal access token used to communicate with
  the DigitalOcean v2 API. This may also be set using the
  `DIGITALOCEAN_API_TOKEN` environmental variable.

- `spaces_key` (string) - The access key used to communicate with Spaces.
  This may also be set using the `DIGITALOCEAN_SPACES_ACCESS_KEY`
  environmental variable.

- `spaces_secret` (string) - The secret key used to communicate with Spaces.
  This may also be set using the `DIGITALOCEAN_SPACES_SECRET_KEY`
  environmental variable.

- `spaces_region` (string) - The name of the region, such as `nyc3`, in which
  to upload the image to Spaces.

- `space_name` (string) - The name of the specific Space where the image file
  will be copied to for import. This Space must exist when the
  post-processor is run.

- `image_name` (string) - The name to be used for the resulting DigitalOcean
  custom image.

- `image_regions` (array of string) - A list of DigitalOcean regions, such
  as `nyc3`, where the resulting image will be available for use in creating
  Droplets.

Optional:

- `image_description` (string) - The description to set for the resulting
  imported image.

- `image_distribution` (string) - The name of the distribution to set for
  the resulting imported image.

- `image_tags` (array of strings) - A list of tags to apply to the resulting
  imported image.

- `keep_input_artifact` (boolean) - if true, do not delete the source virtual
  machine image after importing it to the cloud. Defaults to false.

- `skip_clean` (boolean) - Whether we should skip removing the image file
  uploaded to Spaces after the import process has completed. "true" means
  that we should leave it in the Space, "false" means to clean it out.
  Defaults to `false`.

- `space_object_name` (string) - The name of the key used in the Space where
  the image file will be copied to for import. This is treated as a
  [template engine](/docs/templates/engine). Therefore, you
  may use user variables and template functions in this field.
  If not specified, this will default to `packer-import-{{timestamp}}`.

- `timeout` (number) - The length of time in minutes to wait for individual
  steps in the process to successfully complete. This includes both importing
  the image from Spaces as well as distributing the resulting image to
  additional regions. If not specified, this will default to 20.
