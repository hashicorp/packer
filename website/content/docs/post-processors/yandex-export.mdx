# Yandex.Cloud Compute Image Exporter Post-Processor

Type: `yandex-export`

The Yandex.Cloud Compute Image Exporter post-processor exports the resultant image
from a yandex build as a qcow2 file to Yandex Object Storage.

The exporter uses the same Yandex.Cloud folder and
authentication credentials as the yandex build that produced the image.
A temporary VM is started in the folder using these credentials. The VM
mounts the built image as a secondary disk, then dumps the image in qcow2 format.
The VM then uploads the file to the provided Yandex Object Storage `paths` using the same
credentials.

As such, assigned Service Account must have write permissions to the Yandex Object Storage
`paths`. A new temporary static access keys from assigned Service Account used to upload
image.

## Configuration

### Required:

#### Access

@include 'builder/yandex/AccessConfig-required.mdx'

#### Export

@include 'post-processor/yandex-export/Config-required.mdx'

#### Common

@include 'builder/yandex/CloudConfig-required.mdx'

@include 'post-processor/yandex-export/ExchangeConfig-required.mdx'

### Optional:

#### Access

@include 'builder/yandex/AccessConfig-not-required.mdx'

#### Export

@include 'post-processor/yandex-export/Config-not-required.mdx'

#### Common

@include 'builder/yandex/CommonConfig-not-required.mdx'

#### Instance

@include 'builder/yandex/InstanceConfig-not-required.mdx'

#### Disk

@include 'builder/yandex/DiskConfig-not-required.mdx'

#### Network

@include 'builder/yandex/NetworkConfig-not-required.mdx'

## Basic Example

The following example builds a Compute image in the folder with id `b1g8jvfcgmitdrslcn86`, with an
Service Account whose keyfile is `account.json`. After the image build, a temporary VM
will be created to export the image as a qcow2 file to
`s3://packer-export/my-exported-image.qcow2` and
`s3://packer-export/image-number-two.qcow2`. `keep_input_artifact` is true, so the
source Compute image won't be deleted after the export.

In order for this example to work, the service account associated with builder
must have write access to both `s3://packer-export/my-exported-image.qcow2` and
`s3://packer-export/image-number-two.qcow2` and get permission to modify temporary instance
(create new disk, attach to instance, etc).
