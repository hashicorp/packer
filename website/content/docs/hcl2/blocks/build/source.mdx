# The `source` block

`@include 'from-1.5/beta-hcl2-note.mdx'`

A `source` block nested in a `build` block allows to use an already defined
source and to set specific fields.

```hcl
# builds.pkr.hcl
source "lxd" "arch" {
  image = "archlinux"
}

build {
  source "lxd.arch" {
    // setting the name field allows to rename the source only for this build
    // section.
    name = "nomad"
    output_image = "nomad"
  }

  provisioner "shell" {
    inline = [ "echo installing nomad" ]
  }
}

build {
  source "lxd.arch" {
    name = "consul"
    output_image = "consul"
  }

  provisioner "shell" {
    inline = [ "echo installing consul" ]
  }
}
```

This allows to have commonly defined source settings with specific parts of it
defined inside the specific build block.

-> **Note:** It is **not allowed** to set the same field in a top-level source
block and in a used source block. For example, if in the above example, the
top-level "amazon-ebs.example" source block also had an `output` field;
Packer would error.
