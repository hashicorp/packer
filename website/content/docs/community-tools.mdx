# Download Packer Community Projects

Packer has a vibrant community of contributors who have built a number of great
tools on top of Packer. There are also quite a few projects demonstrating the
power of Packer templates.

## Third-Party plugins

To learn more about how to use community plugins, or how to build your own,
refer to the docs on [extending Packer](/packer/docs/plugins/install)

If you have built a plugin and would like to add it to this community list,
make a pull request so that we can document your contribution.

Refer to the following topics to learn about plugins built by the community of Packer users and
vendors. We do not test or maintain community plugins.
