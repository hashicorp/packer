# Packer Documentation

[Packer](https://www.packer.io/) is an open source tool that enables you to create identical machine images for multiple platforms from a single source template. A common use case is creating "golden images" that teams across an organization can use in cloud infrastructure.

To install Packer and learn the standard Packer workflow, try the [Get Started tutorials](https://learn.hashicorp.com/packer).
