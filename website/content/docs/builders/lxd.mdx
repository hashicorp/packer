# LXD Builder

Type: `lxd`
Artifact BuilderId: `lxd`

The `lxd` Packer builder builds containers for LXD. The builder starts an LXD
container, runs provisioners within this container, then saves the container as
an LXD image.

The LXD builder requires a modern linux kernel and the `lxd` package. This
builder does not work with LXC.

## Basic Example

Below is a fully functioning example.

```json
{
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "lxd",
      "name": "lxd-xenial",
      "image": "ubuntu-daily:xenial",
      "output_image": "ubuntu-xenial",
      "publish_properties": {
        "description": "Trivial repackage with Packer"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Configuration Reference

### Required:

- `image` (string) - The source image to use when creating the build
  container. This can be a (local or remote) image (name or fingerprint).
  E.G. `my-base-image`, `ubuntu-daily:x`, `08fababf6f27`, ...

  ~> Note: The builder may appear to pause if required to download a
  remote image, as they are usually 100-200MB. `/var/log/lxd/lxd.log` will
  mention starting such downloads.

### Optional:

- `init_sleep` (string) - The number of seconds to sleep between launching
  the LXD instance and provisioning it; defaults to 3 seconds.

- `name` (string) - Name of the builder. Defaults to `lxd`.

- `container_name` (string) - Name of the build container.
  Defaults to `packer-$name`.

- `profile` - Name of the LXD profile used for the build container.
  Defaults to `default`.

- `output_image` (string) - The name of the output artifact. Defaults to
  `name`.

- `command_wrapper` (string) - Lets you prefix all builder commands, such as
  with `ssh` for a remote build host. Defaults to `""`.

- `publish_properties` (map\[string\]string) - Pass key values to the publish
  step to be set as properties on the output image. This is most helpful to
  set the description, but can be used to set anything needed. See [here](https://stgraber.org/2016/03/30/lxd-2-0-image-management-512/) for more properties.

- `launch_config` (map\[string\]string) - List of key/value pairs you wish to
  pass to `lxc launch` via `--config`. Defaults to empty.
