# Builders

Builders create machines and generate images from those machines for various platforms. Packer also has some builders that perform helper tasks, like running provisioners.

Packer has the following types of builders:

- [Plugin](/plugins): Each plugin has its own associated set of builders. For example, there are separate builders for EC2, VMware, VirtualBox, etc.
- [File](/docs/builders/file): The `file` builder creates an artifact from a file.
- [Null](/docs/builders/null): The `null` builder sets up an SSH connection and runs the provisioners.
- [Custom](/docs/plugins/creation/custom-builders): You can write new builders for new or existing platforms.
- [Community-Supported](/docs/builders/community-supported): The Packer community develops and maintains builders for several additional platforms.

Refer to the [`source`](/docs/templates/hcl_templates/blocks/source) block documentation to learn more about configuring builders in the Packer templating language.
