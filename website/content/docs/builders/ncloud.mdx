# NAVER CLOUD PLATFORM Builder

Type: `ncloud`
Artifact BuilderId: `ncloud.server.image`

The `ncloud` builder allows you to create server images using the [NAVER Cloud
Platform](https://www.ncloud.com/).

## Configuration Reference

### Required:

- `access_key` (string) - User's access key. Go to [\[Account
  Management &gt; Authentication
  Key\]](https://www.ncloud.com/mypage/manage/authkey) to create and view
  your authentication key.

- `secret_key` (string) - User's secret key paired with the access
  key. Go to [\[Account Management &gt; Authentication
  Key\]](https://www.ncloud.com/mypage/manage/authkey) to create and view
  your authentication key.

- `server_image_product_code` (string) - Product code of an image to create.
  (member_server_image_no is required if not specified)

### Optional:
- `server_product_code` (string) - Product (spec) code to create.

- `vpc_no` (string) - The ID of the VPC where you want to place the Server Instance. If this field is left blank, Packer will try to get the VPC ID from the `subnet_no`.
  (You are required to least one between two parameters if u want using VPC environment: `vpc_no` or `subnet_no`)

- `subnet_no` (string) - The ID of the Subnet where you want to place the Server Instance. If this field is left blank, Packer will try to get the Public Subnet ID from the `vpc_no`.

- `member_server_image_no` (string) - Previous image code. If there is an
  image previously created, it can be used to create a new image.
  (`server_image_product_code` is required if not specified)

- `server_image_name` (string) - Name of an image to create.

- `server_image_description` (string) - Description of an image to create.

- `block_storage_size` (number) - You can add block storage ranging from 10
  GB to 2000 GB, in increments of 10 GB.

- `access_control_group_no` (string) - This is used to allow
  winrm access when you create a Windows server. An ACG that specifies an
  access source (`0.0.0.0/0`) and allowed port (5985) must be created in
  advance if you use CLASSIC env. If this field is left blank, Packer will create temporary ACG for automatically in VPC environment.

- `user_data` (string) - User data to apply when launching the instance. Note
  that you need to be careful about escaping characters due to the templates
  being JSON. It is often more convenient to use `user_data_file`, instead.
  Packer will not automatically wait for a user script to finish before
  shutting down the instance this must be handled in a provisioner.

- `user_data_file` (string) - Path to a file that will be used for the user
  data when launching the instance.

- `region` (string) - Name of the region where you want to create an image.
  (default: Korea)
  - values: Korea / US-West / HongKong / Singapore / Japan / Germany

-> **Warning:** Please note that if you're setting up WinRM for provisioning, you'll probably want to turn it off or restrict its permissions as part of a shutdown script at the end of Packer's provisioning process.

## Note

- You can only create as many public IP addresses as the number of server
  instances you own. Before running Packer, please make sure that the number
  of public IP addresses previously created is not larger than the number of
  server instances (including those to be used to create server images).
- When you forcibly terminate the packer process or close the terminal
  (command) window where the process is running, the resources may not be
  cleaned up as the packer process no longer runs. In this case, you should
  manually clean up the resources associated with the process.
