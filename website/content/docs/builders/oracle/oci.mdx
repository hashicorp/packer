# Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Builder

Type: `oracle-oci`

The `oracle-oci` Packer builder is able to create new custom images for use
with [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](https://cloud.oracle.com) (OCI). The builder
takes a base image, runs any provisioning necessary on the base image after
launching it, and finally snapshots it creating a reusable custom image.

It is recommended that you familiarise yourself with the [Key Concepts and
Terminology](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/GSG/Concepts/concepts.htm)
prior to using this builder if you have not done so already.

The builder _does not_ manage images. Once it creates an image, it is up to you
to use it or delete it.

## Authorization

The Oracle OCI API requires that requests be signed with the RSA public key
associated with your
[IAM](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm)
user account. For a comprehensive example of how to configure the required
authentication see the documentation on [Required Keys and
OCIDs](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm)
([Oracle Cloud
IDs](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm)).
Alternatively you can use [Instance
Principals](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/callingservicesfrominstances.htm)
in which case you don't need the above user authorization.

## Configuration Reference

There are many configuration options available for the `oracle-oci` builder. In
addition to the options listed here, a
[communicator](/docs/templates/communicator) can be configured for this
builder.

In addition to the options defined there, a private key file
can also be supplied to override the typical auto-generated key:

@include 'packer-plugin-sdk/communicator/SSH-Private-Key-File-not-required.mdx'

### Required

- `availability_domain` (string) - The name of the [Availability
  Domain](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/General/Concepts/regions.htm)
  within which a new instance is launched and provisioned. The names of the
  Availability Domains have a prefix that is specific to your
  [tenancy](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/GSG/Concepts/concepts.htm#two).

  To get a list of the Availability Domains, use the
  [ListAvailabilityDomains](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/identity/latest/AvailabilityDomain/ListAvailabilityDomains)
  operation, which is available in the IAM Service API.

- `base_image_ocid` (string) - The OCID of the [base
  image](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Compute/References/images.htm)
  to use. This is the unique identifier of the image that will be used to
  launch a new instance and provision it.

  To get a list of the accepted image OCIDs, use the
  [ListImages](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Image/ListImages)
  operation available in the Core Services API.

- `base_image_filter` (map of strings) - As an alternative to providing `base_image_ocid`,
  the user can supply search criteria, and Packer will use the the most recent image that meets
  all search criteria. If no image meets all search criteria, Packer returns an error. The
  following fields, if specified, must match exactly:

  - `compartment_id` - The OCID of the compartment to find the image. If not specified, will use `compartment_ocid`
    used for the instance.
  - `display_name` - The full name of the image, e.g., `Oracle-Linux-7.8-2020.05.26-0`
  - `operating_system` - The operating system used on the image, e.g., `Oracle Linux`
  - `operating_system_version` - The version of the operating system on the image, e.g., `7.8`
  - `shape` - A shape that the image supports. If not specified, will use `shape` used for the instance

  Additionally, the following field takes a regular expression:

  - `display_name_search` - a regular expression for the display name, e.g., `^Oracle-Linux`. This
    is ignored if `display_name` is also specified under `base_image_filter`. If no images match
    the expression, Packer returns an error. If multiple images match, the most recent is used.

  `base_image_filter` is ignored if `base_image_ocid` is also specified.

- `compartment_ocid` (string) - The OCID of the
  [compartment](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/GSG/Tasks/choosingcompartments.htm) that the instance will run in.

- `shape` (string) - The template that determines the number of CPUs, amount
  of memory, and other resources allocated to a newly created instance.

  To get a list of the available shapes, use the
  [ListShapes](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/Shape/ListShapes)
  operation available in the Core Services API.

- `subnet_ocid` (string) - The name of the subnet within which a new instance
  is launched and provisioned.

  To get a list of your subnets, use the
  [ListSubnets](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Subnet/ListSubnets)
  operation available in the Core Services API.

  Note: the subnet must be configured to allow access via your chosen
  [communicator](/docs/communicators) (communicator defaults to
  [SSH tcp/22](/docs/communicators/ssh#ssh_port)).

### Optional

- `use_instance_principals` (boolean) - Whether to use [Instance
  Principals](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/callingservicesfrominstances.htm)

  that is attached to the instance. Possible keys (all optional) are: `assign_public_ip` (bool),
  `display_name` (string), `hostname_lable` (string), `nsg_ids` (list), `private_ip` (string),
  `skip_source_dest_check` (bool), `subnet_id` (string), `tags` (map of string), and `defined_tags`

  when launching the instance. Defaults to `50`.

- `image_launch_mode` (string) - Specifies the configuration mode for launching instances.
  Valid values are `"NATIVE"`, `"EMULATED"`, `"PARAVIRTUALIZED"`, and `"CUSTOM"`. See the
  [Oracle CLI docs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/tools/oci-cli/2.12.5/oci_cli_docs/cmdref/compute/image/create.html#cmdoption-launch-mode)
  for more information about these modes.

- `use_private_ip` (boolean) - Use private ip addresses to connect to the
  instance via ssh.

<!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->
- `metadata` (map of strings) - Metadata optionally contains custom metadata
  key/value pairs provided in the configuration. While this can be used to
  set metadata\["user_data"\] the explicit "user_data" and
  "user_data_file" values will have precedence. An instance's metadata can
  be obtained from at [http://169.254.169.254](http://169.254.169.254) on
  the launched instance.
<!-- markdown-link-check-enable -->

- `user_data` (string) - User data to be used by cloud-init. See [the Oracle
  docs](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/LaunchInstanceDetails)
  for more details. Generally speaking, it is easier to use the
  `user_data_file`, but you can use this option to put either the plaintext
  data or the base64 encoded data directly into your Packer config. Packer
  will not automatically wait for a user script to finish before shutting
  down the instance this must be handled in a provisioner.

- `user_data_file` (string) - Path to a file to be used as user data by
  cloud-init. See [the Oracle
  docs](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/LaunchInstanceDetails)
  for more details. Example: `"user_data_file": "./boot_config/myscript.sh"`

- `tags` (map of strings) - Add one or more freeform tags to the resulting
  custom image. See [the Oracle
  docs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/taggingoverview.htm)
  for more details. Example:

```yaml
'tags':
  'tag1': 'value1'
  'tag2': 'value2'
```

- `defined_tags` (map of map of strings) - Add one or more defined tags for a given namespace to the resulting
  custom image. See [the Oracle
  docs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/taggingoverview.htm)
  for more details. Example:

```yaml
'tags':
  'namespace': { 'tag1': 'value1', 'tag2': 'value2' }
```

## Basic Example

Here is a basic example. Note that account specific configuration has been
substituted with the letter `a` and OCIDS have been shortened for brevity.

```json
{
  "availability_domain": "aaaa:PHX-AD-1",
  "base_image_ocid": "ocid1.image.oc1.phx.aaaaaaaa5yu6pw3riqtuhxzov7fdngi4tsteganmao54nq3pyxu3hxcuzmoa",
  "compartment_ocid": "ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaa",
  "image_name": "ExampleImage",
  "shape": "VM.Standard1.1",
  "ssh_username": "opc",
  "subnet_ocid": "ocid1.subnet.oc1..aaa",
  "type": "oracle-oci"
}
```

## Using Instance Principals

Here is a basic example. Note that account specific configuration has been
substituted with the letter `a` and OCIDS have been shortened for brevity.

```json
{
  "use_instance_principals": "true",
  "availability_domain": "aaaa:PHX-AD-1",
  "base_image_ocid": "ocid1.image.oc1.phx.aaaaaaaa5yu6pw3riqtuhxzov7fdngi4tsteganmao54nq3pyxu3hxcuzmoa",
  "compartment_ocid": "ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaa",
  "image_name": "ExampleImage",
  "shape": "VM.Standard2.1",
  "ssh_username": "opc",
  "subnet_ocid": "ocid1.subnet.oc1..aaa",
  "type": "oracle-oci"
}
```

```shell-session
[opc@packerhost ~]$ packer build packer.json
oracle-oci: output will be in this color.

==> oracle-oci: Creating temporary ssh key for instance...
==> oracle-oci: Creating instance...
==> oracle-oci: Created instance (ocid1.instance.oc1.phx.aaa).
==> oracle-oci: Waiting for instance to enter 'RUNNING' state...
==> oracle-oci: Instance 'RUNNING'.
==> oracle-oci: Instance has IP: 10.10.10.10.
==> oracle-oci: Using ssh communicator to connect: 10.10.10.10
==> oracle-oci: Waiting for SSH to become available...
==> oracle-oci: Connected to SSH!
==> oracle-oci: Creating image from instance...
==> oracle-oci: Image created.
==> oracle-oci: Terminating instance (ocid1.instance.oc1.phx.aaa)...
==> oracle-oci: Terminated instance.
Build 'oracle-oci' finished.

==> Builds finished. The artifacts of successful builds are:
--> oracle-oci: An image was created: 'ExampleImage' (OCID: ocid1.image.oc1.phx.aaa) in region 'us-phoenix-1'
[opc@packerhost ~]$
```

## Assigning Tags and Network Security Groups to the Instance

Tags are useful for breaking down costs and usage. The keys `instance_tags`
and `instance_defined_tags` are assigned to the temporary instance,
whereas `tags` and `defined_tags` are assigned to the resulting image.

Network Security Groups (NSGs) are used for granting networking permissions
to the instance. Depending on network (VCN and subnet) setup, this may be
required for Packer to successfully SSH into the instance. NSGs are a property
of the virtual network interface card (VNIC) attached to the instance, and
are listed in `nsg_ids` under `create_vnic_details`.

```json
{
  "name": "base-image-{{isotime \"20060102030405\"}}",
  "type": "oracle-oci",
  "availability_domain": "aaaa:PHX-AD-1",
  "base_image_ocid": "ocid1.image.oc1.iad.aaa",
  "compartment_ocid": "ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaa",
  "image_name": "my-image-{{isotime \"20060102030405\"}}",
  "shape": "VM.Standard.E2.1",
  "subnet_ocid": "ocid1.subnet.oc1.iad.aaa",
  "use_private_ip": "true",
  "instance_name": "packer-build-{{isotime \"20060102030405\"}}",
  "instance_tags": { "testing": "yes" },
  "instance_defined_tags": {
    "Operations": {
      "Team": "CostCenter",
      "Environment": "prod"
    }
  },
  "create_vnic_details": {
    "assign_public_ip": "false",
    "display_name": "testing-123",
    "nsg_ids": ["ocid1.networksecuritygroup.oc1.iad.aaa"]
  },
  "tags": {
    "CreationDate": "{{isotime \"20060102 03:04:05 MST\"}}"
  }
}
```

## Base Image Filter Example

Note that `base_image_filter` gets passed as a string, then interpreted as a
regular expression. This means that all back-slashes must be doubled, e.g.,
use `\\w+` to mean `\w+`, and `\\\\` to create the regular expression equivalent
of `\\` (which will search for a literal back-slash).

```json
{
  "name":                "base-image-{{isotime \"20060102030405\"}}",
  "type":                "oracle-oci",
  "availability_domain": "aaaa:PHX-AD-1",
  "base_image_filter": {
    "operating_system": "Oracle Linux",
    "operating_system_version": "7.8",
    "display_name_search": "^Oracle-Linux-7\\.8-2020\\.\\d+"
  }
  ...
}
```
