# Hetzner Cloud Builder

Type: `hcloud`

The `hcloud` Packer builder is able to create new images for use with [Hetzner
Cloud](https://www.hetzner.cloud). The builder takes a source image, runs any
provisioning necessary on the image after launching it, then snapshots it into
a reusable image. This reusable image can then be used as the foundation of new
servers that are launched within the Hetzner Cloud.

The builder does _not_ manage images. Once it creates an image, it is up to you
to use it or delete it.

## Configuration Reference

There are many configuration options available for the builder. They are
segmented below into two categories: required and optional parameters. Within
each category, the available configuration keys are alphabetized.

In addition to the options listed here, a
[communicator](/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/communicators) can be configured for this
builder.

### Required Builder Configuration options:

- `token` (string) - The client TOKEN to use to access your account. It can
  also be specified via environment variable `HCLOUD_TOKEN`, if set.

- `image` (string) - ID or name of image to launch server from. Alternatively
  you can use `image_filter`.

- `location` (string) - The name of the location to launch the server in.

- `server_type` (string) - ID or name of the server type this server should
  be created with.

### Optional:

- `endpoint` (string) - Non standard api endpoint URL. Set this if you are
  using a Hetzner Cloud API compatible service. It can also be specified via
  environment variable `HCLOUD_ENDPOINT`.

- `image_filter` (object) - Filters used to populate the `filter`
  field. Example:

  ```json
  {
    "image_filter": {
      "with_selector": ["name==my-image"],
      "most_recent": true
    }
  }
  ```

  This selects the most recent image with the label `name==my-image`. NOTE:
  This will fail unless _exactly_ one AMI is returned. In the above example,
  `most_recent` will cause this to succeed by selecting the newest image.

  - `with_selector` (list of strings) - label selectors used to select an
    `image`. NOTE: This will fail unless _exactly_ one image is returned.
    Check the official hcloud docs on
    [Label Selectors](https://docs.hetzner.cloud/#overview-label-selector)
    for more info.

  - `most_recent` (boolean) - Selects the newest created image when true.
    This is most useful if you base your image on another packer build image.

  You may set this in place of `image`, but not both.

- `server_name` (string) - The name assigned to the server. The Hetzner Cloud
  sets the hostname of the machine to this value.

- `snapshot_name` (string) - The name of the resulting snapshot that will
  appear in your account as image description. Defaults to `packer-{{timestamp}}` (see
  [configuration templates](/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/engine) for more info). If you want to reference the image as a sample in your terraform configuration please use the image id or the `snapshot_labels`.

- `snapshot_labels` (map of key/value strings) - Key/value pair labels to
  apply to the created image.

- `poll_interval` (string) - Configures the interval in which actions are
  polled by the client. Default `500ms`. Increase this interval if you run
  into rate limiting errors.

- `user_data` (string) - User data to launch with the server. Packer will not
  automatically wait for a user script to finish before shutting down the
  instance this must be handled in a provisioner.

- `user_data_file` (string) - Path to a file that will be used for the user
  data when launching the server.

- `ssh_keys` (array of strings) - List of SSH keys by name or id to be added
  to image on launch.

- `rescue` (string) - Enable and boot in to the specified rescue system. This
  enables simple installation of custom operating systems. `linux64`
  `linux32` or `freebsd64`

## Basic Example

Here is a basic example. It is completely valid as soon as you enter your own
access tokens:

```json
{
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "hcloud",
      "token": "YOUR API KEY",
      "image": "ubuntu-18.04",
      "location": "nbg1",
      "server_type": "cx11",
      "ssh_username": "root"
    }
  ]
}
```
