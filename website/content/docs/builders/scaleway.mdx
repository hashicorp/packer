# Scaleway Builder

Type: `scaleway`

The `scaleway` Packer builder is able to create new images for use with
[Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com). The builder takes a source image, runs
any provisioning necessary on the image after launching it, then snapshots it
into a reusable image. This reusable image can then be used as the foundation
of new servers that are launched within Scaleway.

The builder does _not_ manage snapshots. Once it creates an image, it is up to
you to use it or delete it.

## Configuration Reference

There are many configuration options available for the builder. They are
segmented below into two categories: required and optional parameters. Within
each category, the available configuration keys are alphabetized.

In addition to the options listed here, a
[communicator](/docs/templates/communicator) can be configured for this
builder. In addition to the options defined there, a private key file
can also be supplied to override the typical auto-generated key:

@include 'packer-plugin-sdk/communicator/SSH-Private-Key-File-not-required.mdx'

### Required:

@include 'builder/scaleway/Config-required.mdx'

### Optional:

@include 'builder/scaleway/Config-not-required.mdx'

## Basic Example

Here is a basic example. It is completely valid as soon as you enter your own
access tokens:

```json
{
  "type": "scaleway",
  "project_id": "YOUR PROJECT ID",
  "access_key": "YOUR ACCESS KEY",
  "secret_key": "YOUR SECRET KEY",
  "image": "UUID OF THE BASE IMAGE",
  "zone": "fr-par-1",
  "commercial_type": "DEV1-S",
  "ssh_username": "root",
  "ssh_private_key_file": "~/.ssh/id_rsa"
}
```

When you do not specify the `ssh_private_key_file`, a temporary SSH keypair
is generated to connect the server. This key will only allow the `root` user to
connect the server.
