# CloudStack Builder

Type: `cloudstack`

The `cloudstack` Packer builder is able to create new templates for use with
[CloudStack](https://cloudstack.apache.org/). The builder takes either an ISO
or an existing template as it's source, runs any provisioning necessary on the
instance after launching it and then creates a new template from that instance.

The builder does _not_ manage templates. Once a template is created, it is up
to you to use it or delete it.

## Configuration Reference

There are many configuration options available for the builder. They are
segmented below into two categories: required and optional parameters. Within
each category, the available configuration keys are alphabetized.

In addition to the options listed here, a
[communicator](/docs/templates/communicator) can be configured for this
builder.

### Required:

- `api_url` (string) - The CloudStack API endpoint we will connect to. It can
  also be specified via environment variable `CLOUDSTACK_API_URL`, if set.

- `api_key` (string) - The API key used to sign all API requests. It can also
  be specified via environment variable `CLOUDSTACK_API_KEY`, if set.

- `network` (string) - The name or ID of the network to connect the instance
  to.

- `secret_key` (string) - The secret key used to sign all API requests. It
  can also be specified via environment variable `CLOUDSTACK_SECRET_KEY`, if
  set.

- `service_offering` (string) - The name or ID of the service offering used
  for the instance.

- `source_iso` (string) - The name or ID of an ISO that will be mounted
  before booting the instance. This option is mutually exclusive with
  `source_template`. When using `source_iso`, both `disk_offering` and
  `hypervisor` are required.

- `source_template` (string) - The name or ID of the template used as base
  template for the instance. This option is mutually exclusive with
  `source_iso`.

- `template_os` (string) - The name or ID of the template OS for the new
  template that will be created.

- `zone` (string) - The name or ID of the zone where the instance will be
  created.

### Optional:

- `async_timeout` (number) - The time duration to wait for async calls to
  finish. Defaults to 30m.

- `cidr_list` (array) - List of CIDR's that will have access to the new
  instance. This is needed in order for any provisioners to be able to
  connect to the instance. Defaults to `[ "0.0.0.0/0" ]`. Only required when
  `use_local_ip_address` is `false`.

- `create_security_group` (boolean) - If `true` a temporary security group
  will be created which allows traffic towards the instance from the
  `cidr_list`. This option will be ignored if `security_groups` is also
  defined. Requires `expunge` set to `true`. Defaults to `false`.

- `disk_offering` (string) - The name or ID of the disk offering used for the
  instance. This option is only available (and also required) when using
  `source_iso`.

- `disk_size` (number) - The size (in GB) of the root disk of the new
  instance. This option is only available when using `source_template`.

- `expunge` (boolean) - Set to `true` to expunge the instance when it is
  destroyed. Defaults to `false`.

- `http_directory` (string) - Path to a directory to serve using an HTTP
  server. The files in this directory will be available over HTTP that will
  be requestable from the virtual machine. This is useful for hosting
  kickstart files and so on. By default this is "", which means no HTTP
  server will be started. The address and port of the HTTP server will be
  available as variables in `user_data`. This is covered in more detail
  below.

- `http_get_only` (boolean) - Some cloud providers only allow HTTP GET calls
  to their CloudStack API. If using such a provider, you need to set this to
  `true` in order for the provider to only make GET calls and no POST calls.

- `http_port_min` and `http_port_max` (number) - These are the minimum and
  maximum port to use for the HTTP server started to serve the
  `http_directory`. Because Packer often runs in parallel, Packer will choose
  a randomly available port in this range to run the HTTP server. If you want
  to force the HTTP server to be on one port, make this minimum and maximum
  port the same. By default the values are 8000 and 9000, respectively.

- `hypervisor` (string) - The target hypervisor (e.g. `XenServer`, `KVM`) for
  the new template. This option is required when using `source_iso`.

- `eject_iso` (boolean) - If `true` make a call to the CloudStack API, after
  loading image to cache, requesting to check and detach ISO file (if any)
  currently attached to a virtual machine. Defaults to `false`. This option
  is only available when using `source_iso`.

- `eject_iso_delay` (time.Duration) - Configure the duration time to wait, making
  sure virtual machine is able to finish installing OS before it ejects safely.
  Requires `eject_iso` set to `true` and this option is only available when
  using `source_iso`.

- `keypair` (string) - The name of the SSH key pair that will be used to
  access the instance. The SSH key pair is assumed to be already available
  within CloudStack.

- `instance_name` (string) - The name of the instance. Defaults to
  "packer-UUID" where UUID is dynamically generated.

- `prevent_firewall_changes` (boolean) - Set to `true` to prevent network
  ACLs or firewall rules creation. Defaults to `false`.

- `project` (string) - The name or ID of the project to deploy the instance
  to.

- `public_ip_address` (string) - The public IP address or it's ID used for
  connecting any provisioners to. If not provided, a temporary public IP
  address will be associated and released during the Packer run.

- `public_port` (number) - The fixed port you want to configure in the port
  forwarding rule. Set this attribute if you do not want to use the a random
  public port.

- `security_groups` (array of strings) - A list of security group IDs or
  names to associate the instance with.

- `ssl_no_verify` (boolean) - Set to `true` to skip SSL verification.
  Defaults to `false`.

- `template_display_text` (string) - The display text of the new template.
  Defaults to the `template_name`.

- `template_featured` (boolean) - Set to `true` to indicate that the template
  is featured. Defaults to `false`.

- `template_name` (string) - The name of the new template. Defaults to
  `packer-{{timestamp}}` where timestamp will be the current time.

- `template_public` (boolean) - Set to `true` to indicate that the template
  is available for all accounts. Defaults to `false`.

- `template_password_enabled` (boolean) - Set to `true` to indicate the
  template should be password enabled. Defaults to `false`.

- `template_requires_hvm` (boolean) - Set to `true` to indicate the template
  requires hardware-assisted virtualization. Defaults to `false`.

- `template_scalable` (boolean) - Set to `true` to indicate that the template
  contains tools to support dynamic scaling of VM cpu/memory. Defaults to
  `false`.

- `temporary_keypair_name` (string) - The name of the temporary SSH key pair
  to generate. By default, Packer generates a name that looks like
  `packer_<UUID>`, where &lt;UUID&gt; is a 36 character unique identifier.

- `user_data` (string) - User data to launch with the instance. This is a
  [template engine](/docs/templates/engine) see _User Data_ bellow for
  more details. Packer will not automatically wait for a user script to
  finish before shutting down the instance this must be handled in a
  provisioner.

- `user_data_file` (string) - Path to a file that will be used for the user
  data when launching the instance. This file will be parsed as a [template
  engine](/docs/templates/engine) see _User Data_ bellow for more
  details.

- `use_local_ip_address` (boolean) - Set to `true` to indicate that the
  provisioners should connect to the local IP address of the instance.

## User Data

The available variables are:

- `HTTPIP` and `HTTPPort` - The IP and port, respectively of an HTTP server
  that is started serving the directory specified by the `http_directory`
  configuration parameter. If `http_directory` isn't specified, these will be
  blank. Example: `{{.HTTPIP}}:{{.HTTPPort}}/path/to/a/file/in/http_directory`
