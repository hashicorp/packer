# VMware Builder (from ISO)

Type: `vmware-iso`
Artifact BuilderId: `mitchellh.vmware`
If remote_type is esx: Artifact BuilderId: `mitchellh.vmware-esx`

This VMware Packer builder is able to create VMware virtual machines from an ISO
file as a source. It currently supports building virtual machines on hosts
running [VMware Fusion](https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/overview.html) for
OS X, [VMware
Workstation](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation/overview.html) for Linux
and Windows, and [VMware Player](https://www.vmware.com/products/player/) on
Linux. It can also build machines directly on [VMware vSphere
Hypervisor](https://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere-hypervisor/) using SSH as
opposed to the vSphere API.

The builder builds a virtual machine by creating a new virtual machine from
scratch, booting it, installing an OS, provisioning software within the OS, then
shutting it down. The result of the VMware builder is a directory containing all
the files necessary to run the virtual machine.

## Basic Example

Here is a basic example. This example is not functional. It will start the OS
installer but then fail because we don't provide the preseed file for Ubuntu to
self-install. Still, the example serves to show the basic configuration:

## Boot Configuration

@include 'packer-plugin-sdk/bootcommand/BootConfig.mdx'

@include 'packer-plugin-sdk/bootcommand/VNCConfig.mdx'

-> **Note**: for the `HTTPIP` to be resolved correctly, your VM's network
configuration has to include a `hostonly` or `nat` type network interface.
If you are using this feature, it is recommended to leave the default network
configuration while you are building the VM, and use the `vmx_data_post` hook
to modify the network configuration after the VM is done building.

#### Optional:

@include 'packer-plugin-sdk/bootcommand/VNCConfig-not-required.mdx'

@include 'packer-plugin-sdk/bootcommand/BootConfig-not-required.mdx'

For more examples of various boot commands, see the sample projects from our
[community templates page](/community-tools#templates).

## VMX Template

The heart of a VMware machine is the "vmx" file. This contains all the virtual
hardware metadata necessary for the VM to function. Packer by default uses a
[safe, flexible VMX
file](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer/blob/20541a7eda085aa5cf35bfed5069592ca49d106e/builder/vmware/step_create_vmx.go#L84).
But for advanced users, this template can be customized. This allows Packer to
build virtual machines of effectively any guest operating system type.

~> **This is an advanced feature.** Modifying the VMX template can easily
cause your virtual machine to not boot properly. Please only modify the template
if you know what you're doing.

Within the template, a handful of variables are available so that your template
can continue working with the rest of the Packer machinery. Using these
variables isn't required, however.

- `Name` - The name of the virtual machine.
- `GuestOS` - The VMware-valid guest OS type.
- `DiskName` - The filename (without the suffix) of the main virtual disk.
- `ISOPath` - The path to the ISO to use for the OS installation.
- `Version` - The Hardware version VMWare will execute this vm under. Also
  known as the `virtualhw.version`.

@include 'builders/building_on_remote_vsphere_hypervisor.mdx'

### VNC port discovery

Packer needs to decide on a port to use for VNC when building remotely. To find
an open port, we try to connect to ports in the range of `vnc_port_min` to
`vnc_port_max`. If we notice something is listening on a port in the range, we
try to connect to the next one, and so on until we find a port that has nothing
listening on it. If you have many clients building on the ESXi host, there
might be competition for the VNC ports. You can adjust how long packer waits
for a connection timeout by setting `PACKER_ESXI_VNC_PROBE_TIMEOUT`. This
defaults to 15 seconds. Set this shorter if vnc connections are refused, and
set it longer if Packer can't find an open port. This is intended as an
advanced configuration option. Please make sure your firewall settings are
correct before adjusting.

### Using a Floppy for Linux kickstart file or preseed

Depending on your network configuration, it may be difficult to use packer's
built-in HTTP server with ESXi. Instead, you can provide a kickstart or preseed
file by attaching a floppy disk. An example below, based on RHEL:

```json
{
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "vmware-iso",
      "floppy_files": ["folder/ks.cfg"],
      "boot_command": "<tab> text ks=floppy <enter><wait>"
    }
  ]
}
```

It's also worth noting that `ks=floppy` has been deprecated. Later versions of
the Anaconda installer (used in RHEL/CentOS 7 and Fedora) may require
a different syntax to source a kickstart file from a mounted floppy image.

```json
{
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "vmware-iso",
      "floppy_files": ["folder/ks.cfg"],
      "boot_command": "<tab> inst.text inst.ks=hd:fd0:/ks.cfg <enter><wait>"
    }
  ]
}
```
