# The `hcp_packer_registry` block

The `hcp_packer_registry` block allows operators the ability to customize the metadata sent to
HCP Packer Registry. It configures the details of an image that is created or updated within HCP PAR.

The presence of a `hcp_packer_registry` block will enable HCP PAR mode and all the builds within that build block
will be pushed to the remote registry as far the appropriate HCP credentials are set (`HCP_CLIENT_ID` and `HCP_CLIENT_SECRET`).

```hcl
# file: builds.pkr.hcl
source "file" "basic-example" {
  content = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet"
  target = "sample_artifact"
}

build {
   name = "example-artifact"

   hcp_packer_registry {
    description = <<EOT
Some nice description about the image which artifact is being published to HCP Packer Registry. =D
    EOT

    labels = {
      "foo-version" = "3.4.0",
      "foo" = "bar",
    }
  }

  sources = ["sources.file.basic-example"]
}
```

- `description` (string) - The image description. Useful to provide a summary about the image. The description will appear
  at the image's main page and will be updated whenever it is changed and a new build is pushed to HCP PAR. Should contain
  a maximum of 255 characters.

- `labels` (map[string]string) - Map of labels. Can provide any information, such as tools versions
  (e.g. go 1.16, python 3.5, etc...). The labels will appear at the image's main page and will be updated
  whenever it is changed and a new build is pushed to HCP PAR.
