# The `hcp_packer_registry` block

The `hcp_packer_registry` block allows operators the ability to customize the metadata sent to
HCP Packer Registry. It configures the details of an image that is created or updated within the HCP Packer registry.

The presence of a `hcp_packer_registry` block will enable the HCP Packer registry mode and all the builds within that build block
will be pushed to the remote registry if the appropriate HCP credentials are set (`HCP_CLIENT_ID` and `HCP_CLIENT_SECRET`). If no HCP credentials are set Packer will fail the build and exit immediately to avoid any potential artifact drift between the build providers and the HCP Packer registry.

```hcl
# file: builds.pkr.hcl
source "file" "basic-example" {
  content = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet"
  target = "sample_artifact"
}

build {
   hcp_packer_registry {
    slug = "sample-artifact"

    description = <<EOT
Some nice description about the image which artifact is being published to HCP Packer Registry. =D
    EOT

    labels = {
      "foo-version" = "3.4.0",
      "foo" = "bar",
    }
  }

  sources = ["sources.file.basic-example"]
}
```

- `slug` (string) - The image name when published to the HCP Packer registry. Should always be the same, otherwise a new image will be created.
  Defaults to `build.name` if not set. Will be overwritten if `HCP_PACKER_BUCKET_NAME` is set.

- `description` (string) - The image description. Useful to provide a summary about the image. The description will appear
  at the image's main page and will be updated whenever it is changed and a new build is pushed to the HCP Packer registry. Should contain
  a maximum of 255 characters. Defaults to `build.description` if not set.

- `labels` (map[string]string) - Map of labels. Can provide any information, such as tools versions
  (e.g. go 1.17, python 3.5, etc...). The labels will appear at the image's main page and will be updated
  whenever it is changed and a new build is pushed to the HCP Packer registry.
