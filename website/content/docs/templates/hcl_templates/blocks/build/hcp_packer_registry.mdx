# The `hcp_packer_registry` block

The `hcp_packer_registry` block lets you customize the metadata Packer sends to HCP Packer Registry. It configures the details of an image that is created or updated within the HCP Packer registry.

To get started with HCP Packer, refer to the [HCP Packer documentation](https://cloud.hashicorp.com/docs/packer) or try the [Get Started with HCP Packer](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/packer/hcp-get-started) collection on HashiCorp Learn.

## Usage

This block is available from version 1.7.7 of Packer.

The presence of a `hcp_packer_registry` block in a build block will enable HCP
Packer mode. Packer will push all builds within that build block to the remote
registry if the appropriate HCP credentials are set (`HCP_CLIENT_ID` and
`HCP_CLIENT_SECRET`). If no HCP credentials are set, Packer will fail the build
and exit immediately to avoid any potential artifact drift between the defined
builders (source blocks) and the HCP Packer registry.

~> **Note:** You will receive an error if you try to reference metadata from a deactivated or deleted registry. An administrator can manually deactivate or delete a registry, and HCP Packer automatically deactivates registries with billing issues.

```hcl
# file: builds.pkr.hcl
source "happycloud" "macos" {
  os = "macos_amd64"
}

build {
   hcp_packer_registry {
    bucket_name = "ios-dev"

    description = <<EOT
Some nice description about the image which artifact is being published to HCP Packer Registry. =D
    EOT

    bucket_labels = {
      "team" = "ios-development",
      "os"   = "macos"
    }

    build_labels = {
      "xcode"   = "11.3.0"
      "version" = "Big Sur"
    }
  }

  sources = ["source.happycloud.macos"]
}
```

- `bucket_name` (string) - The image name when published to the HCP Packer
  registry. Should always be the same, otherwise a new image will be created.
  Defaults to `build.name` if not set. Will be overwritten if
  `HCP_PACKER_BUCKET_NAME` is set.

- `bucket_labels` (map[string]string) - Map of labels. Can provide any information,
  such as tools versions (e.g. go 1.17, python 3.5, etc...). The bucket labels will
  appear at the image's main page and will be updated whenever it is changed
  and a new iteration for the bucket is pushed to the HCP Packer registry.

- `build_labels` (map[string]string) - Map of labels. Can provide any information,
  such as tools versions (e.g. go 1.17, python 3.5, etc...). The build labels will
  appear in the build section of an iteration. Build labels are specific to an iteration
  and will be added to a build when is pushed to the HCP Packer registry.
  Updates to build labels on a completed iteration is not allowed.

- `description` (string) - The image description. Useful to provide a summary
  about the image. The description will appear at the image's main page and
  will be updated whenever it is changed and a new build is pushed to the HCP
  Packer registry. Should contain a maximum of 255 characters. Defaults to
  `build.description` if not set.

- `labels` (map[string]string) - Deprecated in Packer 1.7.9. See [`bucket_labels`](#bucket_labels) for details.
