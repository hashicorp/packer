# `join` Function

`join` produces a string by concatenating together all elements of a given
list of strings with the given delimiter.

```hcl
join(separator, list)
```

## Examples

```shell-session
> join(", ", ["foo", "bar", "baz"])
foo, bar, baz
> join(", ", ["foo"])
foo
```

  by separating a single string using a given delimiter.
