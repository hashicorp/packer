# `legacy_strftime` — UTC time, formated using the ISO C standard format 

The `legacy_strftime` function returns the current date and time using the given
format string. The format string follows strftime's datetime formatting.

This function has been provided to create backwards compatibility with Packer's
legacy JSON templates. However, we recommend that you upgrade your HCL Packer
template to use
[`timestamp`](/packer/docs/templates/hcl_templates/functions/datetime/timestamp) and
[`formatdate`](/packer/docs/templates/hcl_templates/functions/datetime/formatdate)
together as soon as is convenient.

-> **Note:** If you are using a large number of builders, provisioners or
post-processors, the strftime may be slightly different for each one because it
is from when the plugin is launched not the initial Packer process. In order to
avoid this and make the timestamp consistent across all plugins, set it as a
user variable and then access the user variable within your plugins.

## Examples

```shell-session
> legacy_strftime("%Y-%m")
2021-08
```

data.
- [`timestamp`](/packer/docs/templates/hcl_templates/functions/datetime/timestamp) returns the current date and time in a format
suitable for input to `formatdate`.
- [`formatdate`](/packer/docs/templates/hcl_templates/functions/datetime/formatdate) can convert the resulting timestamp to
  other date and time formats.
