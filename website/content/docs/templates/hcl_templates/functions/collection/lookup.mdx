# `lookup` Function

`lookup` retrieves the value of a single element from a map, given its key.
If the given key does not exist, the given default value is returned instead.

```hcl
lookup(map, key, default)
```

## Examples

```shell-session
> lookup({a="ay", b="bee"}, "a", "what?")
ay
> lookup({a="ay", b="bee"}, "c", "what?")
what?
```
