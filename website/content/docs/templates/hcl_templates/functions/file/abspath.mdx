# `abspath` Function

`abspath` takes a string containing a filesystem path and converts it
to an absolute path. That is, if the path is not absolute, it will be joined
with the current working directory.

Referring directly to filesystem paths in resource arguments may cause spurious
diffs if the same configuration is applied from multiple systems or on
different host operating systems. We recommend using filesystem paths only for
transient values, such as the argument to
[`file`](/docs/templates/hcl_templates/functions/file) (where only the contents are then
stored).

## Examples

```shell-session
> abspath(path.root)
/home/user/some/packer/root
```
