# `file` Function

`file` reads the contents of a file at the given path and returns them as
a string.

```hcl
file(path)
```

Strings in the Packer language are sequences of Unicode characters, so
this function will interpret the file contents as UTF-8 encoded text and
return the resulting Unicode characters. If the file contains invalid UTF-8
sequences then this function will produce an error.

This function can be used only with files that already exist on disk
at the beginning of a Packer run. Functions do not participate in the
dependency graph, so this function cannot be used with files that are generated
dynamically during a Packer operation.

## Examples

```shell-session
> file("${path.folder}/hello.txt")
Hello World
```
