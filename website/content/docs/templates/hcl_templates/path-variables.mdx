# Path variables

- `path.cwd`: the directory from where Packer was started.

- `path.root`: the directory of the input HCL file or the input folder.

## Examples

```HCL
locals {
  settings_file  = "${path.cwd}/settings.txt"
  scripts_folder = "${path.root}/scripts"
  root           = path.root
}
```
