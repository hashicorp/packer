# Path variables

- `path.cwd`: the directory from where Packer was started.

- `path.root`: the directory of the input HCL file or the input folder.

## Examples

```HCL
locals {
  settings_file  = "${path.cwd}/settings.txt"
  scripts_folder = "${path.root}/scripts"
  root           = path.root
}
```

- [`abspath`](/packer/docs/templates/hcl_templates/functions/file/abspath) takes a string containing
  a filesystem path and converts it to an absolute path.

- [`basename`](/packer/docs/templates/hcl_templates/functions/file/basename) returns _only_ the last
  portion of a filesystem path, discarding the portion that would be returned
  by `dirname`.

- [`fileset`](/packer/docs/templates/hcl_templates/functions/file/fileset) enumerates a set of
  regular file names given a path and pattern.

- [`dirname`](/packer/docs/templates/hcl_templates/functions/file/dirname) returns all of the
  segments of a filesystem path _except_ the last, discarding the portion that
  would be returned by `basename`.
