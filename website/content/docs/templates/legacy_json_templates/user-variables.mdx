# Template User Variables

User variables allow your templates to be further configured with variables
from the command-line, environment variables, Vault, or files. This lets you
parameterize your templates so that you can keep secret tokens,
environment-specific data, and other types of information out of your
templates. This maximizes the portability of the template.

Using user variables expects you to know how [configuration
templates](/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/engine) work. If you don't know how
configuration templates work yet, please read that page first.

## Usage

In order to set a user variable, you must define it either within the
`variables` section within your template, or using the command-line `-var` or
`-var-file` flags.

Even if you want a user variable to default to an empty string, it is best to
explicitly define it. This explicitness helps reduce the time it takes for
newcomers to understand what can be modified using variables in your template.

The `variables` section is a key/value mapping of the user variable name to a
default value. A default value can be the empty string. An example is shown
below:

```json
{
  "variables": {
    "aws_access_key": "",
    "aws_secret_key": ""
  },

  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "amazon-ebs",
      "access_key": "{{user `aws_access_key`}}",
      "secret_key": "{{user `aws_secret_key`}}"
      // ...
    }
  ]
}
```

In the above example, the template defines two user variables: `aws_access_key`
and `aws_secret_key`. They default to empty values. Later, the variables are
used within the builder we defined in order to configure the actual keys for
the Amazon builder.

If the default value is `null`, then the user variable will be _required_. This
means that the user must specify a value for this variable or template
validation will fail.

User variables are used by calling the `{{user}}` function in the form of
`{{user 'variable'}}`. This function can be used in _any value_ but `type`
within the template: in builders, provisioners, _anywhere outside the `variables` section_.
User variables are available globally within the rest of the template.

## Environment Variables

Environment variables can be used within your template using user variables.
The `env` function is available _only_ within the default value of a user
variable, allowing you to default a user variable to an environment variable.
An example is shown below:

```json
{
  "variables": {
    "my_secret": "{{env `MY_SECRET`}}"
  }
}
```

This will default "my_secret" to be the value of the "MY_SECRET" environment
variable (or an empty string if it does not exist).

-> **Why can't I use environment variables elsewhere?** User variables are
the single source of configurable input to a template. We felt that having
environment variables used _anywhere_ in a template would confuse the user
about the possible inputs to a template. By allowing environment variables only
within default values for user variables, user variables remain as the single
source of input to a template that a user can easily discover using
`packer inspect`.

-> **Why can't I use `~` for home variable?** `~` is an special variable
that is evaluated by shell during a variable expansion. As Packer doesn't run
inside a shell, it won't expand `~`.

## Consul keys

Consul keys can be used within your template using the `consul_key` function.
This function is available _only_ within the default value of a user variable,
for reasons similar to environment variables above.

```json
{
  "variables": {
    "soft_versions": "{{ consul_key `my_image/softs_versions/next` }}"
  }
}
```

This will default `soft_versions` to the value of the key
`my_image/softs_versions/next` in consul.

The configuration for consul (address, tokens, ...) must be specified as
environment variables, as specified in the
[Documentation](https://www.consul.io/docs/commands#environment-variables).

## Vault Variables

Secrets can be read from [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) and used within
your template as user variables. the `vault` function is available _only_
within the default value of a user variable, allowing you to default a user
variable to a vault secret.

An example of using a v2 kv engine:

If you store a value in vault using `vault kv put secret/hello foo=world`, you
can access it using the following template engine:

```json
{
  "variables": {
    "my_secret": "{{ vault `/secret/data/hello` `foo`}}"
  }
}
```

which will assign "my_secret": "world"

An example of using a v1 kv engine:

If you store a value in vault using:

    vault secrets enable -version=1 -path=secrets kv
    vault kv put secrets/hello foo=world

You can access it using the following template engine:

    {
      "variables": {
        "VAULT_SECRETY_SECRET": "{{ vault `secrets/hello` `foo`}}"
      }
    }

This example accesses the Vault path `secret/data/foo` and returns the value
stored at the key `bar`, storing it as "my_secret".

In order for this to work, you must set the environment variables `VAULT_TOKEN`
and `VAULT_ADDR` to valid values.

The api tool we use allows for more custom configuration of the Vault client via
environment variables.

The full list of available environment variables is:

```text
"VAULT_ADDR"
"VAULT_AGENT_ADDR"
"VAULT_CACERT"
"VAULT_CAPATH"
"VAULT_CLIENT_CERT"
"VAULT_CLIENT_KEY"
"VAULT_CLIENT_TIMEOUT"
"VAULT_SKIP_VERIFY"
"VAULT_NAMESPACE"
"VAULT_TLS_SERVER_NAME"
"VAULT_WRAP_TTL"
"VAULT_MAX_RETRIES"
"VAULT_TOKEN"
"VAULT_MFA"
"VAULT_RATE_LIMIT"
```

and detailed documentation for usage of each of those variables can be found
[here](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/commands/#environment-variables).

## AWS Secrets Manager Variables

Secrets can be read from [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/)
and used within your template as user variables. The `aws_secretsmanager` function is
available _only_ within the default value of a user variable, allowing you to default
a user variable to an AWS Secrets Manager secret.

### Plaintext Secrets

```json
{
  "variables": {
    "password": "{{ aws_secretsmanager `globalpassword` }}"
  }
}
```

In the example above it is assumed that the secret `globalpassword` is not
stored as a key pair but as a single non-JSON string value. Which the
`aws_secretsmanager` function will return as a raw string.

### Single Key Secrets

```json
{
  "variables": {
    "password": "{{ aws_secretsmanager `sample/app/password` }}"
  }
}
```

In the example above it is assumed that only one key is stored in
`sample/app/password` if there are multiple keys stored in it then you need
to indicate the specific key you want to fetch as shown below.

### Multiple Key Secrets

```json
{
  "variables": {
    "db_password": "{{ aws_secretsmanager `sample/app/passwords` `db` }}",
    "api_key": "{{ aws_secretsmanager `sample/app/passwords` `api_key` }}"
  }
}
```

In order to use this function you have to configure valid AWS credentials using
one of the following methods:

- [Environment Variables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html)
- [CLI Configuration Files](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html)
- [Container Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-iam-roles.html)
- [Instance Profile Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html)

## Using array values

Some templates call for array values. You can use template variables for these,
too. For example, the `amazon-ebs` builder has a configuration parameter called
`ami_regions`, which takes an array of regions that it will copy the AMI to.
You can parameterize this by using a variable that is a list of regions, joined
by a `,`. For example:

```json
{
  "variables": {
    "destination_regions": "us-west-1,us-west-2"
  },
  "builders": [
    {
      "ami_name": "packer-qs-{{timestamp}}",
      "instance_type": "t2.micro",
      "region": "us-east-1",
      "source_ami_filter": {
        "filters": {
          "name": "*ubuntu-xenial-16.04-amd64-server-*",
          "root-device-type": "ebs",
          "virtualization-type": "hvm"
        },
        "most_recent": true,
        "owners": ["099720109477"]
      },
      "ami_regions": "{{user `destination_regions`}}",
      "ssh_username": "ubuntu",
      "type": "amazon-ebs"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Setting Variables

Now that we covered how to define and use user variables within a template, the
next important point is how to actually set these variables. Packer exposes two
methods for setting user variables: from the command line or from a file.

### From the Command Line

To set user variables from the command line, the `-var` flag is used as a
parameter to `packer build` (and some other commands). Continuing our example
above, we could build our template using the command below. The command is
split across multiple lines for readability, but can of course be a single
line.

```shell-session
$ packer build \
    -var 'aws_access_key=foo' \
    -var 'aws_secret_key=bar' \
    template.json
```

As you can see, the `-var` flag can be specified multiple times in order to set
multiple variables. Also, variables set later on the command-line override any
earlier set variable of the same name.

**warning** If you are calling Packer from cmd.exe, you should double-quote
your variables rather than single-quoting them. For example:

`packer build -var "aws_secret_key=foo" template.json`

### From a File

Variables can also be set from an external JSON file. The `-var-file` flag
reads a file containing a key/value mapping of variables to values and sets
those variables. An example JSON file may look like this:

```json
{
  "aws_access_key": "foo",
  "aws_secret_key": "bar"
}
```

It is a single JSON object where the keys are variables and the values are the
variable values. Assuming this file is in `variables.json`, we can build our
template using the following command:

```text
On Linux :
$ packer build -var-file=variables.json template.json
On Windows :
packer build -var-file variables.json template.json
```

The `-var-file` flag can be specified multiple times and variables from
multiple files will be read and applied. As you'd expect, variables read from
files specified later override a variable set earlier.

Combining the `-var` and `-var-file` flags together also works how you'd
expect. Variables set later in the command override variables set earlier. So,
for example, in the following command with the above `variables.json` file:

```shell-session
$ packer build \
    -var 'aws_access_key=bar' \
    -var-file=variables.json \
    -var 'aws_secret_key=baz' \
    template.json
```

Results in the following variables:

| Variable       | Value |
| -------------- | ----- |
| aws_access_key | foo   |
| aws_secret_key | baz   |

# Sensitive Variables

If you use the environment to set a variable that is sensitive, you probably
don't want that variable printed to the Packer logs. You can make sure that
sensitive variables won't get printed to the logs by adding them to the
"sensitive-variables" list within the Packer template:

```json
{
  "variables": {
    "my_secret": "{{env `MY_SECRET`}}",
    "not_a_secret": "plaintext",
    "foo": "bar"
  },

  "sensitive-variables": ["my_secret", "foo"],
  ...
}
```

The above snippet of code will function exactly the same as if you did not set
"sensitive-variables", except that the Packer UI and logs will replace all
instances of "bar" and of whatever the value of "my_secret" is with
`<sensitive>`. This allows you to be confident that you are not printing
secrets in plaintext to our logs by accident.

# Recipes

## Making a provisioner step conditional on the value of a variable

There is no specific syntax in Packer templates for making a provisioner step
conditional, depending on the value of a variable. However, you may be able to
do this by referencing the variable within a command that you execute. For
example, here is how to make a `shell-local` provisioner only run if the
`do_nexpose_scan` variable is non-empty.

```json
{
  "type": "shell-local",
  "command": "if [ ! -z \"{{user `do_nexpose_scan`}}\" ]; then python -u trigger_nexpose_scan.py; fi"
}
```

## Using HOME Variable

In order to use `$HOME` variable, you can create a `home` variable in Packer:

```json
{
  "variables": {
    "home": "{{env `HOME`}}"
  }
}
```

And this will be available to be used in the rest of the template, i.e.:

```json
{
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "google",
      "account_file": "{{ user `home` }}/.secrets/gcp-{{ user `env` }}.json"
    }
  ]
}
```
