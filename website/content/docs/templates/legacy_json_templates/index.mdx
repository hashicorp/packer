# JSON Templates

These Packer templates are JSON files that configure the various components
of Packer in order to create one or more machine images. Templates are portable,
static, and readable and writable by both humans and computers.

Templates are given to commands such as `packer build`, which will take the
template and actually run the builds within it, producing any resulting machine
images.

## JSON Template Structure

The template is a JSON object that has a set of keys configuring various
components of Packer. The available keys within a template are listed below.
Along with each key, it is noted whether it is required or not.

- `builders` (_required_) is an array of one or more objects that defines the
  builders that will be used to create machine images for this template, and
  configures each of those builders. For more information on how to define
  and configure a builder, read the sub-section on [configuring builders in
  templates](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/builders).

- `description` (optional) is a string providing a description of what the
  template does. This output is used only in the [inspect
  command](/packer/docs/commands/inspect).

- `min_packer_version` (optional) is a string that has a minimum Packer
  version that is required to parse the template. This can be used to ensure
  that proper versions of Packer are used with the template. A max version
  can't be specified because Packer retains backwards compatibility with
  `packer fix`.

- `post-processors` (optional) is an array of one or more objects that
  defines the various post-processing steps to take with the built images. If
  not specified, then no post-processing will be done. For more information
  on what post-processors do and how they're defined, read the sub-section on
  [configuring post-processors in
  templates](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/post-processors).

- `provisioners` (optional) is an array of one or more objects that defines
  the provisioners that will be used to install and configure software for
  the machines created by each of the builders. If it is not specified, then
  no provisioners will be run. For more information on how to define and
  configure a provisioner, read the sub-section on [configuring provisioners
  in templates](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/provisioners).

- `variables` (optional) is an object of one or more key/value strings that
  defines user variables contained in the template. If it is not specified,
  then no variables are defined. For more information on how to define and
  use user variables, read the sub-section on [user variables in
  templates](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/user-variables).

## Comments

JSON doesn't support comments and Packer reports unknown keys as validation
errors. If you'd like to comment your template, you can prefix a _root level_
key with an underscore. Example:

```json
{
  "_comment": "This is a comment",
  "builders": [{}]
}
```

**Important:** Only _root level_ keys can be underscore prefixed. Keys within
builders, provisioners, etc. will still result in validation errors.

-> **Note:** Packer supports HCL2 from version 1.6.0. The HashiCorp
Configuration Language does support comments anywhere in template files.
If comments are important to you, consider upgrading your
JSON template to HCL2 using the `packer hcl2_upgrade` command.

One workaround if you are not ready to upgrade to HCL is to use jq to strip
unsupported comments from a Packer template before you run `packer build`.

For example, here is a file named `commented_template.json`:

```json
{
  "_comment": ["this is", "a multi-line", "comment"],
  "builders": [
    {
      "_comment": "this is a comment inside a builder",
      "type": "null",
      "communicator": "none"
    }
  ],
  "_comment": "this is a root level comment",
  "provisioners": [
    {
      "_comment": "this is a different comment",
      "type": "shell",
      "_comment": "this is yet another comment",
      "inline": ["echo hellooooo"]
    }
  ]
}
```

If you use the following jq command:

```shell-session
$ jq 'walk(if type == "object" then del(._comment) else . end)' commented_template.json > uncommented_template.json
```

The tool will produce a new file containing:

```json
{
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "null",
      "communicator": "none"
    }
  ],
  "provisioners": [
    {
      "type": "shell",
      "inline": ["echo hellooooo"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Once you've got your uncommented file, you can call `packer build` on it like
you normally would.

If your install of jq does not have the walk function and you get an error like

```text
jq: error: walk/1 is not defined at <top-level>,
```

You can create a file `~/.jq` and add the [walk function](https://github.com/stedolan/jq/blob/ad9fc9f559e78a764aac20f669f23cdd020cd943/src/builtin.jq#L255-L262) to it by hand.

## Example Template

Below is an example of a basic template that could be invoked with
`packer build`. It would create an instance in AWS, and once running copy a
script to it and run that script using SSH.

-> **Note:** This example requires an account with Amazon Web Services.
There are a number of parameters which need to be provided for a functional
build to take place. See the [Amazon builder](/packer/plugins/builders/amazon)
documentation for more information.

```json
{
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "amazon-ebs",
      "access_key": "...",
      "secret_key": "...",
      "region": "us-east-1",
      "source_ami": "ami-fce3c696",
      "instance_type": "t2.micro",
      "ssh_username": "ubuntu",
      "ami_name": "packer {{timestamp}}"
    }
  ],

  "provisioners": [
    {
      "type": "shell",
      "script": "setup_things.sh"
    }
  ]
}
```
