description: |
  The `password` data will generate a reasonably complex password for use during the Packer build.Using a random complex computer-generated temporary password can improve the security of the overall infrastructure, and make systems less prone to be compromised later on.

# `password`

`Use Case(s)`

1. When installing any operating system from ISO that requires the root or administrator password to be set. This data source allows you to generate a temporary password, pass it to the build commands, or as parameters to provisioners.
For example, in Ubuntu, the temporary password will allow the root or ubuntu user to be configured, and in the same process be used to create an Ansible user, after which the admin or root account is disabled, or deleted.

2. In scenarios where passwords are treated as "need-to-know", Packer can lessen the burden of the organization by generating new passwords whenever a new template is created, exporting it, and allowing a subsequent process to store it in a secret manager, where other processes can pick it up when interacting with the templates.

3. Keep secrets out of source control

4. Minimize the configuration of CI/CD systems, by generating temporary secrets.

## Basic Example

```hcl
data "password" "sample" {
  length = 16
  special = true
  lower = true
  upper = true
}
```

## Configuration Reference

Configuration options are organized below into two categories: required and
optional. Within each category, the available options are alphabetized and
described.
To generate a password, at least one of the fieldsâ€”`lower`, `upper`, or `special` must be set to true.
The default special charset is `!@#$%&*()-_=+[]{}<>:?`

### Required:

@include 'datasource/password/Config-required.mdx'

### Not Required:
@include 'datasource/password/Config-not-required.mdx'

## Datasource outputs

The outputs for this datasource are as follows:

@include 'datasource/password/DatasourceOutput.mdx'
