# Data Sources

Data sources allow data to be fetched for use in Packer configuration. Use of data sources
allows a build to use information defined outside of Packer.

See the [`data`](/docs/templates/hcl_templates/datasources) block documentation to learn more
about working with data sources. For information on an individual data source,
choose it from the sidebar.

-> **Note:** Data sources is a feature exclusively available to HCL2 templates included in Packer `v1.7.0` (and newer).
