# Packer Image Iteration Data Source

Type: `packer-image-iteration`

The `Packer Image Iteration` Data Source retrieves information about an
iteration from the HCP Packer registry. This information can be parsed to
provide a source image to various Packer builders.

~> **Note:** HCP Packer is currently in public beta. Tutorials can be found at our [HashiCorp Learn](https://learn.hashicorp.com/packer) website.
For more information about HCP Packer, see [Announcing HCP Packer](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/announcing-hcp-packer).

## Basic Example

Below is a fully functioning example. It stores information about an image
iteration, which can then be parsed and accessed using HCL tools.

```hcl
data "packer-image-iteration" "hardened-source" {
  bucket = "hardened-ubuntu-16-04"
  channel = "production-stable"
}
```

## Configuration Reference

Configuration options are organized below into two categories: required and
optional. Within each category, the available options are alphabetized and
described.

### Required:

@include 'datasource/packer-image-iteration/Config-required.mdx'

There are currently no optional fields for this datasource, though we intend
to add filtering fields in the future.
