# Packer Image Iteration Data Source

Type: `packer-image-iteration`

The `Packer Image Iteration` Data Source retrieves information about an
iteration from the HCP Packer registry. This information can be parsed to
provide a source image to various Packer builders.

~> **Note:** HCP Packer is under active development, and we are currently offering a [public beta version](https://portal.cloud.hashicorp.com) to collect feedback and continue improving the product.
To get started, visit the [HCP Packer documentation](https://cloud.hashicorp.com/docs/packer) or try the [Get Started with HCP Packer](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/packer/hcp-get-started) collection on HashiCorp Learn.

## Basic Example

Below is a fully functioning example. It stores information about an image
iteration, which can then be parsed and accessed using HCL tools.

```hcl
data "packer-image-iteration" "hardened-source" {
  bucket = "hardened-ubuntu-16-04"
  channel = "production-stable"
}
```

## Configuration Reference

Configuration options are organized below into two categories: required and
optional. Within each category, the available options are alphabetized and
described.

### Required:

@include 'datasource/packer-image-iteration/Config-required.mdx'

There are currently no optional fields for this datasource, though we intend
to add filtering fields in the future.
