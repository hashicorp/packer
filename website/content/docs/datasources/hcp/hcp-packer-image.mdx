# HCP Packer Image Data Source

~> **Note:** This data source has been deprecated, please use [HCP Packer Artifact](/packer/docs/datasources/hcp/hcp-packer-artifact) data source instead.

Type: `hcp-packer-image`

The `HCP Packer Image` Data Source retrieves information about an
image from the HCP Packer registry. This information can be used to
provide a source image to various Packer builders.

To get started with HCP Packer, refer to the [HCP Packer documentation](/hcp/docs/packer) or try the [Get Started with HCP Packer tutorials](/packer/tutorials/hcp-get-started).

~> **Note:** You will receive an error if you try to reference metadata from a deactivated or deleted registry. An administrator can manually deactivate or delete a registry, and HCP Packer automatically deactivates registries with billing issues. Contact [HashiCorp Support](https://support.hashicorp.com/) with questions.

## Revoked Iterations

If an iteration is revoked, the `hcp-packer-iteration` data source will fail and Packer won't proceed with the build. Building new images from a revoked image is not compliant.
Iterations that are scheduled to be revoked will still be considered valid until the revocation date.

## Basic Example

Below is a fully functioning example. It stores information about an image,
which can then be parsed and accessed as a variable.

```hcl
data "hcp-packer-image" "example" {
  bucket_name = "hardened-ubuntu-16-04"
  iteration_id = "${data.hcp-packer-iteration.hardened-source.id}"
  cloud_provider = "aws"
  region = "us-east-1"
}
```

## Full Example

This data source can be used in conjunction with the hcp-packer-iteration
data source to retrieve an image ID using a channel. You provide the channel
name to the iteration data source, then use the iteration source in the image
data source, then use the image data source inside your source block.

```hcl
# Retrieves information about the HCP Packer "iteration"; an "iteration" can be
# thought of as all the metadata created by a single call of `packer build`.
data "hcp-packer-iteration" "hardened-source" {
  bucket_name = "hardened-ubuntu-16-04"
  channel = "packer-test"
}

# Retrieves information about the HCP Packer "image"; an image can be thought
# of as all the metadata (including the artifact names) created by a single
# "source" builder; this can include multiple images so we provide a cloud
# region to disambiguate.
data "hcp-packer-image" "foo" {
  bucket_name = "hardened-ubuntu-16-04"
  iteration_id = data.hcp-packer-iteration.hardened-source.id
  cloud_provider = "aws"
  region = "us-east-1"
}

# This source uses the output from a previous Packer build. By using the
# HCP Packer registry in this way, you can easily create build pipelines where
# a single base image can be customized in multiple secondary layers.
source "amazon-ebs" "packer-secondary" {
  source_ami       = data.hcp-packer-image.foo.id
  # ...
}
```

## Configuration Reference

Configuration options are organized below into two categories: required and
optional. Within each category, the available options are alphabetized and
described.

### Required:

@include 'datasource/hcp-packer-image/Config-required.mdx'

### Optional:

~> **Note:** This data source only returns the first found image's metadata filtered by the given options, from the returned list of images associated with the specified iteration. Therefore, if multiple images exist in the same region, it will only pick one of them. In this case, you can filter images by a source build name (Ex: `amazon-ebs.example`) using the `component_type` option.

@include 'datasource/hcp-packer-image/Config-not-required.mdx'

### Output Fields:

@include 'datasource/hcp-packer-image/DatasourceOutput.mdx'
