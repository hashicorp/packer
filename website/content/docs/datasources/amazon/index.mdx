# Amazon Data Sources

Packer is able to fetch data from AWS. To achieve this, Packer comes with data sources to retrieve AMI and secrets information.
Packer supports the following data sources at the moment:

- [amazon-ami](/docs/datasources/amazon/ami) - Filter and fetch an Amazon AMI to output all the AMI information.

- [amazon-secretsmanager](/docs/datasources/amazon/secretsmanager) - Retrieve information
about a Secrets Manager secret version, including its secret value.


## Authentication

The Amazon Data Sources authentication works just like for the [Amazon Builders](/docs/builders/amazon). Both
share the same authentication options and you can refer to the [Amazon Builders authentication](/docs/builders/amazon#authentication)
to learn how to authenticate.
