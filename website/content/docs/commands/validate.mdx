# `validate` Command

The `packer validate` Packer command is used to validate the syntax and
configuration of a [template](/docs/templates). The command will
return a zero exit status on success, and a non-zero exit status on failure.
Additionally, if a template doesn't validate, any error messages will be
outputted.

Example usage:

```shell-session
$ packer validate my-template.pkr.hcl
Template validation failed. Errors are shown below.

Errors validating build 'vmware'. 1 error(s) occurred:

* Either a path or inline script must be specified.
```

## Options

- `-syntax-only` - Only the syntax of the template is checked. The
  configuration is not validated.

- `-except=foo,bar,baz` - Validates all the builds except those with the
  comma-separated names. In legacy JSON templates, build names default to the
  types of their builders (e.g. `docker` or
  `amazon-ebs` or `virtualbox-iso`), unless a specific `name` attribute is
  specified within the configuration. In HCL2 templates, the "name" is the
  source block's "name" label, unless an in-build source definition adds the
  "name" configuration option.

- `-only=foo,bar,baz` - Only validate the builds with the given comma-separated
  names. In legacy JSON templates, build names default to the
  types of their builders (e.g. `docker` or
  `amazon-ebs` or `virtualbox-iso`), unless a specific `name` attribute is
  specified within the configuration. In HCL2 templates, the "name" is the
  source block's "name" label, unless an in-build source definition adds the
  "name" configuration option.

- `-machine-readable` Sets all output to become machine-readable on stdout.
  Logging, if enabled, continues to appear on stderr.

- `-var` - Set a variable in your Packer template. This option can be used
  multiple times. This is useful for setting version numbers for your build.

- `-var-file` - Set template variables from a file.
