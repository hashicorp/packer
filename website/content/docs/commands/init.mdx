# `init` Command

-> **Note:** Packer does not currently have the notion of a state.

-> **Note:** Currently, the plugin getter only fetches binaries using Github's API,
which [limits the number of requests per hour one can
do](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/rate-limits-for-github-apps#normal-user-to-server-rate-limits),
set the `PKR_GITHUB_API_TOKEN` in order to get more requests per hour.

The `packer init` command is used to download Packer plugin binaries.
This is the first command that should be executed when working with a new or
existing template. This command is always safe to run multiple times. Though
subsequent runs may give errors, this command will never delete anything.

`packer init` will list all installed plugins then download the latest versions
for the ones that are missing.

`packer init -upgrade` will try to get the latest versions for all plugins.



Import a plugin using the [`required_plugin`](/docs/templates/hcl_templates/blocks/packer#specifying-plugin-requirements)
block :

```hcl
packer {
  required_plugins {
    aws = {
      version = ">= 2.7.0"
      source = "azr/aws"
    }
    azure = ">= 2.7.0"
  }
}
```

Packer init will install the latest found version matching the version selection
in the `required_plugins` section. Make sure to set a correct [version constraint
string](/docs/templates/hcl_templates/blocks/packer#version-constraints).


## Options

- `-upgrade` - On top of installing missing plugins, update installed plugins to
  the latest available version, if there is a new higher one. Note that this
  still takes into consideration the version constraint of the config.
