# `plugins remove`

The `plugins remove` subcommand removes a Packer plugin entirely or at a version constraint


```shell-session
$ packer  plugins remove -h
Usage: packer plugins remove <plugin> [<version constraint>]

  This command will remove one or more installed Packer plugins.

  To remove a plugin matching a version constraint for the current OS and architecture.

      packer plugins remove github.com/hashicorp/happycloud v1.2.3

  To remove all versions of a plugin for the current OS and architecture omit the version constraint.

      packer plugins remove github.com/hashicorp/happycloud

  To remove a single plugin binary from the Packer plugin directory specify the absolute path to an installed binary. This syntax does not allow for version matching.

      packer plugins remove ~/.config/plugins/github.com/hashicorp/happycloud/packer-plugin-happycloud_v1.0.0_x5.0_linux_amd64
```

## Remove all installed plugins
The `plugins remove` command can be used in conjunction with the `plugins installed` command to remove all
Packer plugins by piping the results of `plugins installed` to `plugins removed`. 

On a Unix based OS with xargs installed you can remove all plugin versions using the following command:
```shell-session
~>  packer plugins installed | xargs -L1 packer plugins remove
/Users/dev/.config/packer/plugins/github.com/hashicorp/amazon/packer-plugin-amazon_v1.3.2_x5.0_darwin_arm64
/Users/dev/.config/packer/plugins/github.com/hashicorp/azure/packer-plugin-azure_v2.1.3_x5.0_darwin_arm64
```
