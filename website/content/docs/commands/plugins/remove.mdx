# `plugins remove`

The `plugins remove` subcommand removes one or more versions of an installed Packer plugin.

The command is flexible enough to remove all versions at once or just a single version at a time. 
- If a plugin's source address is specified, without a version constraint, all the versions of that plugin will be removed.
- If a version constraint is specified, only the specified version will be removed.
- If a direct path to a plugin is specified, only the specified version will be removed.

Refer to the examples below for details on usage.
```shell-session
To remove a plugin matching a version constraint for the current OS and architecture.

  packer plugins remove github.com/hashicorp/happycloud v1.2.3

To remove all versions of a plugin for the current OS and architecture omit the version constraint.

  packer plugins remove github.com/hashicorp/happycloud

To remove a single plugin binary from the Packer plugin directory specify the absolute path to an installed binary. This syntax does not allow for version matching.

  packer plugins remove ~/.config/plugins/github.com/hashicorp/happycloud/packer-plugin-happycloud_v1.0.0_x5.0_linux_amd64
```

## Remove all installed plugins
The `plugins remove` command can be used in conjunction with the `plugins installed` command to remove all
Packer plugins by piping the results of `plugins installed` to `plugins removed`. 

On a Unix based OS with xargs installed you can remove all plugin versions using the following command:
```shell-session
~>  packer plugins installed | xargs -n1 packer plugins remove
~/.config/packer/plugins/github.com/hashicorp/amazon/packer-plugin-amazon_v1.3.2_x5.0_darwin_arm64
~/.config/packer/plugins/github.com/hashicorp/azure/packer-plugin-azure_v2.1.3_x5.0_darwin_arm64
```
