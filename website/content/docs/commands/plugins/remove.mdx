# `plugins remove`

The `plugins remove` subcommand removes a Packer plugin at a version constraint

```shell-session
$ packer  plugins remove -h
Usage: packer plugins remove <plugin> [<version constraint>]

  This command will remove all Packer plugins matching version constraint and
  the current OS and architecture.
  When the version is omitted all installed versions will be removed.

```
