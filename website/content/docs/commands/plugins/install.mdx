# `plugins install`

The `plugins install` subcommand installs a Packer plugin at a version constraint

```shell-session
$ packer plugins install -h
Usage: packer plugins install <plugin> [<version constraint>]

  This command will install the most recent compatible Packer plugin matching
  version constraint. When the version constraint is omitted, the most recent
  version will be installed.

  Ex: packer plugins install github.com/hashicorp/happycloud v1.2.3
```
