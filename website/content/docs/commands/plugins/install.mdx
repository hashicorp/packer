# `plugins install`

The `plugins install` subcommand installs a Packer plugin.

The requested plugin will be remotely installed by default at its latest version, unless a version
constraint is specified.
The command also supports installing plugins from a locally-sourced binary, along with its
expected source location.

```shell-session
$ packer plugins install -h
Usage: packer plugins install [OPTIONS...] <plugin> [<version constraint>]

  This command will install the most recent compatible Packer plugin matching
  version constraint. When the version constraint is omitted, the most recent
  version will be installed.

  Ex: packer plugins install github.com/hashicorp/happycloud v1.2.3
      packer plugins install --path ./packer-plugin-happycloud "github.com/hashicorp/happycloud"

Options:
  -path <path>                  Install the plugin from a locally-sourced plugin binary.
                                This installs the plugin where a normal invocation would, but will
                                not try to download it from a remote location, and instead
                                install the binary in the Packer plugins path. This option cannot
                                be specified with a version constraint.
  -force                        Forces reinstallation of plugins, even if already installed.
