# `plugins`

The `plugins` command groups subcommands for interacting with Packers' plugins.

- `installed` lists all installed plugins and their version. Ex: `packer plugins installed`.
- `install` a plugin version with `packer plugins install <plugin> <version>`.
- `required` lists required plugins. Ex: `packer plugins required <path>`.
- `remove` a plugin version with `packer plugins remove <plugin> <version>`.
  Ommit the version parameter to remove all versions.

Related but not under the `plugins` command :

- `packer init <path>` will install all plugins required by a config.
